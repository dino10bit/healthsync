# SyncWell: Cross-Platform Health & Fitness Data Synchronization

This repository contains the complete Product Requirements Document (PRD) suite for the SyncWell application.

## 1. Project Vision

SyncWell is a mobile application designed to solve the problem of data fragmentation in the digital health and fitness market. It acts as a secure "digital bridge," allowing users to synchronize their health data (e.g., steps, workouts, sleep) between various popular platforms like Garmin, Fitbit, Strava, Apple Health, and Google Fit.

The primary goal is to provide a reliable, user-friendly, and privacy-focused solution for users who are invested in multiple health ecosystems.

## 2. Document Governance

To ensure clarity and consistency across the PRD suite, this section outlines the formal governance structure for the documentation.

### 2.1. Document Hierarchy

In cases of conflict or inconsistency between documents, the following hierarchy must be respected. Documents at a higher level of the hierarchy serve as the source of truth for the documents below them.

1.  **`01-context-vision.md`**: The highest-level document defining the overall project vision, business goals, and strategic direction.
2.  **`02-product-scope.md`**: Defines the scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), including features, user personas, and prioritization. It must conform to the vision.
3.  **`04-user-stories.md`**: Translates the product scope into actionable user stories with detailed acceptance criteria. Must conform to the defined scope.
4.  **`06-technical-architecture.md`**: Provides the detailed technical blueprint for implementing the user stories. The architecture must be designed to fulfill the requirements of the user stories and the non-functional requirements of the higher-level documents.

### 2.2. Change Management

All changes to PRD documents must be accompanied by an entry in the document's "Version History" table, summarizing the change and the author. This ensures a clear audit trail for all decisions.

### 2.3. Glossary of Terms

A central `GLOSSARY.md` file is maintained at the root of this repository to ensure a single, consistent definition for all business and technical terms. All other documents should defer to this glossary.
