# PRD Section 21: Risks, Constraints & Mitigation

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a consolidated and actively managed register of the most critical risks facing the SyncWell project. Its purpose is to move from a reactive "fire-fighting" mindset to a proactive, professional approach to risk management. We identify, assess, and plan for potential problems before they occur.

This living document is a strategic dashboard of the primary challenges that require focus. For the **solo developer**, it is a tool for prioritizing mitigation efforts and preparing contingency plans. For **investors**, it demonstrates foresight, maturity, and a clear-headed approach to navigating and mitigating uncertainty.

## 2. Risk Management Framework

### 2.1. Risk Assessment Matrix

Risks are assessed and prioritized based on their Probability and Impact, resulting in a Risk Level.

| Probability | Impact: Low | Impact: Medium | Impact: High | Impact: Critical |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | Medium | High | High | Critical |
| **Medium** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Low** | Low | Low | Medium | High |

### 2.2. RACI Matrix

For a solo developer, the RACI matrix clarifies the different roles they must play.

| Task / Area | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mitigating Technical Risks** | Developer | Developer | (External Mentor/Peer) | Users (via Changelog) |
| **Mitigating Legal Risks**| Developer | Developer | Legal Counsel | Users (via Policy Updates)|
| **Mitigating Market Risks**| Product Manager | Product Manager | Users (via Feedback) | (Investors) |
| **Managing Burnout**| Individual | Individual | (Family/Mentor) | - |

*   **Note on Solo-Developer Context:** For a solo developer, this RACI matrix serves as a conceptual tool rather than a literal delegation matrix. Its purpose is to explicitly acknowledge the different "hats" the developer must wear (e.g., acting as the 'Developer', the 'Product Manager', the 'Legal Counsel'). This helps in consciously switching contexts and ensuring that all aspects of a task (e.g., the legal implications of a feature) are considered.

## 3. Consolidated Risk Register

This register categorizes and assesses the top risks to the project.

| ID | Category | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R-19 | **External Dependency**| A third-party API provider makes a breaking change, disabling a key integration. | **High** | **High** | **High** |
| R-59 | **External Dependency**| SyncWell exhausts a third-party API's rate limit, causing widespread sync failures for that provider. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-55 | **Security** | A vulnerability in the backend leads to a leak of user OAuth tokens from Secrets Manager. | **Low** | **Critical** | **High** |
| R-62 | **Architecture** | A "cache stampede" event (e.g., after a deployment) causes a sudden, massive load on DynamoDB, leading to throttling and failures. | **Low** | **High** | **Medium** |
| R-63 | **Architecture** | Cross-region data replication lag for DynamoDB or Secrets Manager exceeds the RPO, leading to data inconsistencies during a failover. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| R-64 | **Architecture** | A sudden, massive influx of sync requests (e.g., due to a viral event) or a temporary downstream service outage overwhelms the worker fleet, causing dropped jobs and system instability. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-37 | **Human Resources** | The solo developer experiences burnout, leading to a significant project slowdown. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-14 | **Technical/OS** | Changes in platform background execution policies break automatic syncing. | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |
| R-04 | **Market** | The product fails to gain traction and attract a sufficient user base to be viable. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-61 | **Product/UX** | The addition of numerous power-user features leads to a complex UI that alienates the core, less-technical user persona. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| R-65 | **Human Resources** | The solo developer is a single point of failure for on-call incident response, creating a significant operational risk. | **High** | **High** | **High** |
| R-66 | **Strategic** | The deep integration with AWS-specific managed services creates a high degree of vendor lock-in, making a future migration to another cloud provider difficult and expensive. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| R-67 | **Architecture** | The move to a container-based model with Fargate, while necessary for scale, introduces additional operational overhead compared to a purely serverless Lambda approach. | **Medium** | **Low** | **Low** |
| R-68 | **Architecture** | A single "viral user" generates extremely high traffic, causing their own requests to be throttled by DynamoDB due to a hot partition. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| R-69 | **Architecture** | **(Critical)** The initial architecture projects a worst-case of ~45,000 concurrent Lambda executions, which is financially and technically infeasible for the MVP. | **High** | **Critical** | **Critical** |
| R-70 | **External Dependency** | **(High)** A key integration (Garmin) relies on an unofficial, reverse-engineered API that could be disabled at any time. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-71 | **External Dependency** | **(High)** The use of Firebase Authentication creates a hard dependency on a non-AWS service for a critical function (user login). | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |

## 4. Detailed Mitigation & Contingency Plans

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan (If Risk Occurs) | Contingency Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rate Limit Exhaustion (R-59)** | - Implement the **distributed, global rate limiting** system using ElastiCache.<br>- Configure conservative limits for each provider in the `DataProvider` SDK.<br>- Prioritize real-time syncs over historical backfills when the limit is approached. | - The rate limiter will automatically throttle requests, delaying jobs rather than failing them.<br>- If limits are too low, they can be adjusted in configuration without a full deployment. | The rate limiter's "throttled requests" metric spikes. |
| **Cache Stampede (R-62)** | - **Implement Cache Expiration Jitter:** All cache keys will be set with a randomized TTL. Instead of a fixed TTL (e.g., 60 minutes), the TTL will be a random value between a specified min and max (e.g., `random(55, 65)` minutes). This small, random offset ensures that a large number of keys set at the same time do not expire simultaneously, spreading the load on the database over time.<br>- **Implement Cache Warming for Deployments:** A post-deployment script in the CI/CD pipeline will be created. This script will identify a subset of the most frequently accessed cache keys (e.g., based on analytics data) and pre-populate the cache with fresh data for these keys. This prevents an initial "thundering herd" problem immediately following a deployment where the cache is cold.<br>- **Use a "Fetch-on-Miss with Locking" Strategy:** The application code will use a distributed lock (via ElastiCache for Redis) when a cache miss occurs. If multiple requests for the same key miss the cache simultaneously, only the first request will acquire the lock and be allowed to fetch the data from the database. The other requests will wait for the first one to complete and populate the cache. This directly prevents a cache stampede at the application level. | - Rely on DynamoDB On-Demand Capacity to absorb the initial spike.<br>- Manually trigger a cache-warming process if needed. | A sudden spike in DynamoDB read throttling immediately following a deployment. |
| **System Overload (R-64)** | - The architecture uses **Amazon SQS queues** as a buffer between the API layer (EventBridge) and the **AWS Lambda worker service**. This queue acts as a shock absorber, durably persisting all incoming jobs.<br>- The Lambda worker service will automatically scale its concurrency based on the SQS queue depth, managed by the AWS platform.<br>- This design ensures that even a massive spike in requests or a temporary downstream outage will not lead to lost jobs, only a temporary increase in processing latency. | - The system is designed to handle this automatically. The queue will absorb the load, and the Lambda service will scale out to process it.<br>- SQS queue depth and Lambda concurrency are key metrics on our monitoring dashboard. | A sustained, rapid increase in the `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` metric for the primary SQS queue. |
| **Breaking API Change (R-19)** | - Implement robust API error monitoring and alerting.<br>- Maintain a modular `DataProvider` architecture for rapid fixes.<br>- Use contract testing in CI/CD to detect potential breaking changes early. | - Immediately disable the failing integration in-app with a message to users.<br>- Communicate the issue and ETA for a fix via the app's status page.<br>- Prioritize and deploy a hotfix release. | An API error rate for a specific provider spikes by >50% for more than 1 hour. |
| **Developer Burnout (R-37)** | - Adhere to a sustainable pace.<br>- Automate repetitive tasks (testing, CI/CD).<br>- Take scheduled time off. | - Temporarily halt new feature development.<br>- Focus only on critical bug fixes and support.<br>- Communicate a development slowdown to users if necessary. | Developer consistently misses sprint goals for more than two consecutive sprints due to exhaustion. |
| **Security Breach (R-55)** | - Adhere strictly to security best practices (Keychain, etc.).<br>- Commission a pre-launch third-party security audit. | - Immediately force-logout all users of the affected integration.<br>- Deploy a hotfix to patch the vulnerability.<br>- Transparently communicate the nature of the breach and the remediation steps to all users. | Discovery of a critical vulnerability, either internally or via external report. |
| **Market Failure (R-04)**| - Launch with a focused MVP.<br>- Use a public feedback portal to build what users want. | - Analyze user feedback and analytics to identify the biggest gaps.<br>- Pivot the product roadmap to address these gaps.<br>- If still no traction, consider open-sourcing the project or initiating a shutdown. | Paid user growth is flat for more than three consecutive months post-launch. |
| **DynamoDB Hot Partition (R-68)** | - The primary mitigation is the **"hot table" strategy**. A viral user can be flagged, and their data will be moved to a dedicated DynamoDB table with higher provisioned throughput. This isolates their traffic and avoids read-side complexity.<br>- Application logic will check the user's flag and route DB queries to the correct table. | - If the "hot table" strategy is insufficient, the more complex **write-sharding** strategy can be implemented for that user. | A single user's API requests experience sustained DynamoDB throttling errors, confirmed via CloudWatch metrics. |
| **Concurrency Model Feasibility (R-69)** | - **Halt Project:** The project is halted until this risk is mitigated.<br>- **Mandatory PoC:** A proof-of-concept must be executed to validate a more cost-effective concurrency model (e.g., job batching, Fargate). | - If the PoC fails to find a viable alternative, the project's financial model and NFRs must be fundamentally re-evaluated. | This risk is currently active. The trigger for resolution is the successful completion and approval of the PoC. |
| **Garmin API Instability (R-70)** | - **Strategic Decision:** The business must make a formal go/no-go decision on including this integration in the MVP.<br>- **Technical Mitigation:** Implement robust monitoring to detect API changes. Isolate the integration in a modular `DataProvider`. | - If the API is disabled, immediately disable the integration in-app via a feature flag.<br>- Communicate transparently with users about the outage. | Monitoring detects a spike in 4xx or 5xx errors from the Garmin API endpoints. |
| **Firebase Auth Dependency (R-71)** | - **Accepted Risk for MVP:** This is an accepted trade-off to accelerate MVP development.<br>- **Draft Exit Strategy:** A high-level migration plan to a different provider (e.g., Amazon Cognito) must be drafted before launch. | - If a major Firebase outage occurs, communicate with users via status page and social media.<br>- Activate the pre-planned migration strategy if the outage is prolonged. | A major, prolonged outage of Firebase Authentication is announced by Google. |

## 5. Execution Plan
Risk management is a continuous process integrated into the agile development cycle.

1.  **Initial Mitigation:** The execution plans outlined in the relevant sections of this PRD serve as the initial mitigation tasks.
2.  **Sprint-Level Review:** At the beginning of each sprint, the developer will briefly review if any planned stories significantly impact the project's risk profile.
3.  **Quarterly Deep Dive:** A more formal review of this entire document will be conducted quarterly to update risk assessments and adjust mitigation plans.
