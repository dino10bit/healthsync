# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a traceability matrix that links business requirements and user stories to the specific design elements, code modules, and test cases that implement and verify them. The purpose of this matrix is to ensure that all requirements are met by the final product and that a clear, auditable trail exists from a requirement to its implementation and verification.

This is a living document that will be updated continuously throughout the development lifecycle.
