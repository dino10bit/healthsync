# PRD Section 2: Product Scope, Personas & MVP Definition

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the precise scope of the SyncWell application, identifies the target user personas in detail, and outlines a tightly-defined Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For a project to be executed by a **single engineer**, a ruthless and strategic definition of scope is not merely a planning exerciseâ€”it is the single most important factor in ensuring a successful and timely launch. The purpose of this document is to establish clear boundaries that focus development effort on the highest-value features to validate the core business assumptions.

By defining the product scope and MVP using a structured methodology (MoSCoW), we can create a prioritized backlog, manage resources effectively, and build a clear roadmap for post-launch enhancements.

## 2. MVP Philosophy

The MVP for SyncWell is guided by the "depth over breadth" principle. Instead of building a wide array of shallow features, the MVP will focus on executing the core data synchronization loop flawlessly for a curated set of the most popular platforms. The goal is to deliver a complete, polished, and highly reliable solution to a specific, high-value problem, rather than a broad but buggy "beta" product. Success is defined by user trust and reliability, not the sheer number of features.

## 3. Scope Definition (MoSCoW Method)

### Must-Have (Core MVP Requirements)

*   **M1: Core Data Sync Engine:** The underlying system for reliably transferring data must be fully functional.
*   **M2: Key Platform Integrations:** Full support for Google Fit (Android), Apple Health (iOS), Fitbit, Garmin (read-only), and Strava.
*   **M3: Essential Data Types:** Synchronization of Steps, Activities, Sleep, Weight, and Heart Rate.
*   **M4: User Onboarding:** A simple, guided flow to connect at least two apps and configure the first sync.
*   **M5: Sync Configuration UI:** An intuitive interface to create, view, and delete sync connections.
*   **M6: 7-Day Free Trial:** Automatic, no-credit-card-required free trial.
*   **M7: Lifetime License IAP:** A functional one-time purchase option via native app store billing.
*   **M8: Basic Help Center:** An in-app FAQ covering at least the top 10 anticipated issues.

### Should-Have (If Time Permits, High-Priority Post-MVP)

*   **S1: Historical Data Sync:** The ability for premium users to backfill data. This is a key value proposition but is complex and can be deferred from the initial launch if necessary to meet timelines.
*   **S2: Subscription Purchase Option:** Offering a 6-month subscription alongside the lifetime license.
*   **S3: Additional Integrations:** Adding 1-2 more popular integrations like Oura or Suunto.
*   **S4: In-App "What's New" Screen:** A changelog to show users upon app update.

### Could-Have (Long-Term Enhancements)

*   **C1: Advanced Activity Filtering:** Allowing users to filter syncs by activity type, duration, etc.
*   **C2: Data Export/Import:** Features to export or import data using standard file formats (FIT, GPX).
*   **C3: Analytics & Visualizations:** In-app charts and graphs showing user data trends.
*   **C4: Localization:** Translating the app into other languages.

### Won't-Have (Explicitly Out of Scope for Foreseeable Future)

*   **W1: Social Features:** No friend lists, activity sharing, or leaderboards.
*   **W2: Web Dashboard:** The product will be mobile-only.
*   **W3: Direct User-to-User Data Sharing:** The app will not facilitate sharing data between users.
*   **W4: Creating/Editing Health Data:** The app is a data conduit; it will not allow users to manually create or edit health entries.

## 4. User Personas

### Persona 1: The "Data-Driven Athlete" (Alex, 32)

*   **Bio:** Alex is a competitive amateur cyclist and runner. They own a Garmin Edge for cycling, a Polar watch for running, and use Strava as their primary social fitness platform. They are meticulous about tracking their training data, including heart rate zones, power output, and recovery metrics.
*   **Frustrations:** "My Garmin and Polar data don't talk to each other easily. I want to see my running VO2 Max from Polar influence my cycling recovery recommendations in Garmin Connect, but I can't. I also want all my workouts to end up in Strava without manual uploads."
*   **Goals:**
    *   To automate the consolidation of all workout data into a single platform (Strava).
    *   To ensure that detailed, nuanced data (like heart rate variability, cadence) is transferred without loss.
    *   To have a reliable "set it and forget it" solution that works in the background.

### Persona 2: The "Health-Conscious Professional" (Sarah, 45)

*   **Bio:** Sarah is a busy executive who uses technology to help manage her wellness. She wears an Oura ring for sleep tracking, uses a Withings smart scale, and tracks her daily walks and general activity with her Apple Watch. Her primary goal is to maintain a healthy lifestyle amidst a hectic schedule.
*   **Frustrations:** "I have to open three different apps to see my full health picture. My weight from the Withings scale doesn't automatically appear in Apple Health where I track everything else. I just want one app to show me everything without me having to think about it."
*   **Goals:**
    *   To have her key health metrics (sleep, steps, weight) automatically and silently available in her primary health dashboard (Apple Health).
    *   To not have to worry about the technical details or even open the sync app after it's set up.
    *   To trust that her sensitive health data is being handled privately and securely.

## 5. Execution Plan / Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Sprint 1-6: Must-Haves Development**
    *   The entire initial development effort will be focused exclusively on implementing the "Must-Have" features (M1-M8).
    *   The goal is to have a launchable MVP that fulfills the core promise of the product.
2.  **Sprint 7-8: Should-Haves & Polish**
    *   If time permits before the desired launch window, implement the highest-priority "Should-Have" feature (S1: Historical Data Sync).
    *   Otherwise, this time will be used for bug fixing, performance optimization, and preparing for app store submission.
3.  **Post-Launch: Address Remaining Scope**
    *   The remaining "Should-Have" and "Could-Have" items will form the basis of the post-launch product roadmap, to be prioritized based on user feedback and analytics.
