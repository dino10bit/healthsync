# PRD Section 2: Product Scope, Personas & MVP Definition

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the precise scope of the SyncWell application, identifies the target user personas in detail, and outlines a tightly-defined Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For a project to be executed by a **single engineer**, a ruthless and strategic definition of scope is not merely a planning exerciseâ€”it is the single most important factor in ensuring a successful and timely launch. The purpose of this document is to establish clear boundaries that focus development effort on the highest-value features to validate the core business assumptions.

By defining the product scope and MVP using a structured methodology (MoSCoW), we can create a prioritized backlog, manage resources effectively, and build a clear roadmap for post-launch enhancements.

## 2. MVP Philosophy

The MVP for SyncWell is guided by the "depth over breadth" principle. Instead of building a wide array of shallow features, the MVP will focus on executing the core data synchronization loop flawlessly for a curated set of the most popular platforms. The goal is to deliver a complete, polished, and highly reliable solution to a specific, high-value problem, rather than a broad but buggy "beta" product. Success is defined by user trust and reliability, not the sheer number of features.

## 3. Scope Definition (MoSCoW Method)

### Must-Have (Core MVP Requirements)

*   **M1: Core Data Sync Engine:** The underlying system for reliably transferring data must be fully functional. This includes being built on a scalable, **Event-Driven Architecture** to ensure reliability from day one.
*   **M2: The Bridge - Key Platform Integrations:** Full, bi-directional support for **Google Fit** and **Apple Health**. This is the primary market differentiator. Also includes support for other key platforms like Fitbit and Strava. Support for Garmin has been deferred post-MVP due to the unreliability of its unofficial API.
*   **M3: The Holistic View - Essential Data Types:** Synchronization of a broad range of data beyond just workouts, including Steps, Activities, Sleep, Weight, and Heart Rate, to provide a complete health picture.
*   **M4: User Onboarding:** A simple, guided flow to connect at least two apps and configure the first sync.
*   **M5: Sync Health Dashboard:** An intuitive interface to create, view, and delete sync connections, and which clearly displays the status and last sync time for each connection, building user trust.
*   **M6: Transparent Monetization:** A clear, upfront pricing model with a 7-day free trial and a functional **Pro-Tier subscription** via native app store billing. No hidden fees or "bait-and-switch" tactics.
*   **M7: Basic Help Center:** An in-app FAQ covering at least the top 10 anticipated issues.

### Should-Have (If Time Permits, High-Priority Post-MVP)

*   **S1: The Recovery Sync - Historical Data Import:** A key value proposition for stickiness. Allows premium users to backfill their complete data history from major platforms. (US-10)
*   **S2: Smart Conflict Resolution Engine:** A major differentiator. Intelligently detects duplicate entries and allows users to merge them or choose a "source of truth." (US-15)
*   **S3: Pro-Tier Power User Features:** The Pro-Tier subscription unlocks advanced features like manual data editing, advanced merging rules, and granular data export.
*   **S4: Additional Integrations:** Adding 1-2 more popular integrations like Oura or Suunto based on user demand.
*   **S5: Sync Advanced Biometrics:** Support for niche but high-value data types for power users, such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and SpO2. (US-32)
*   **S6: Automatic "Source of Truth":** Allow users to define rules to make the conflict resolution engine even smarter and more automated. (US-34)
*   **S7: Smart Onboarding Backfill (Pro Feature):** Automatically sync the last 7 days of data for new Pro users to provide an immediate "wow" moment and demonstrate the value of the subscription. (US-31)
*   **S8: Interactive Troubleshooting:** An in-app guide to help users solve common sync errors themselves, reducing frustration and support load. (US-35)

### Could-Have (Long-Term Enhancements)

*   **C1: Pre-Sync Data Preview:** A trust-building feature that shows the user exactly what data will be changed before they approve the sync. (US-30)
*   **C2: Family Health Plan:** A subscription tier for families to share the benefits of the Pro-Tier under one bill. (US-18)
*   **C3: Granular Activity Sync Filtering:** Allowing users to filter syncs by specific activity types (e.g., only sync "Running" and "Cycling"). (US-37)
*   **C4: Custom Sync Frequency:** Allow power users to define the sync frequency for each connection to balance data freshness and battery life. (US-29)
*   **C5: Home Screen Widgets:** Provide at-a-glance sync status directly on the user's home screen. (US-36)
*   **C6: Milestone Notifications:** Gamification feature to send encouraging notifications for sync milestones (e.g., "1 million steps synced!"). (US-38)
*   **C7: API Rate Limit Transparency:** Display the status of third-party API rate limits to users to explain potential sync pauses. (US-33)
*   **C8: Localization:** Translating the app into other languages.

### Won't-Have (Explicitly Out of Scope for Foreseeable Future)

*   **W1: Social Features:** No friend lists, activity sharing, or leaderboards.
*   **W2: Web Dashboard:** The product will be mobile-only for the foreseeable future.
*   **W3: Proprietary Data Visualization:** The app will not build its own charting or graphing libraries. It is a data conduit, not an analytics platform. Users should analyze their data in their destination app of choice.
*   **W4: Creating/Editing Health Data (beyond conflict resolution):** The app will not allow users to manually create or edit health entries, except for the specific tools provided in the Smart Conflict Resolution feature.

## 4. User Personas

### Persona 1: The "Data-Driven Athlete" (Alex, 32)

*   **Bio:** Alex is a competitive amateur cyclist and runner. They own a Wahoo bike computer, a Coros watch for running, and use Strava as their primary social fitness platform. They are meticulous about tracking their training data, including heart rate zones, power output, and recovery metrics.
*   **Frustrations:** "My Wahoo and Coros data don't talk to each other easily. I want to see my running VO2 Max from Coros influence my cycling recovery recommendations, but I can't. I also want all my workouts to end up in Strava without manual uploads."
*   **Goals:**
    *   To automate the consolidation of all workout data into a single platform (Strava).
    *   To ensure that detailed, nuanced data (like heart rate variability, cadence) is transferred without loss.
    *   To have a reliable "set it and forget it" solution that works in the background.

### Persona 2: The "Health-Conscious Professional" (Sarah, 45)

*   **Bio:** Sarah is a busy executive who uses technology to help manage her wellness. She wears an Oura ring for sleep tracking, uses a Withings smart scale, and tracks her daily walks and general activity with her Apple Watch. Her primary goal is to maintain a healthy lifestyle amidst a hectic schedule.
*   **Frustrations:** "I have to open three different apps to see my full health picture. My weight from the Withings scale doesn't automatically appear in Apple Health where I track everything else. I just want one app to show me everything without me having to think about it."
*   **Goals:**
    *   To have her key health metrics (sleep, steps, weight) automatically and silently available in her primary health dashboard (Apple Health).
    *   To not have to worry about the technical details or even open the sync app after it's set up.
    *   To trust that her sensitive health data is being handled privately and securely.

## 5. Execution Plan / Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Sprint 1-6: Must-Haves Development**
    *   The entire initial development effort will be focused exclusively on implementing the "Must-Have" features (M1-M8).
    *   The goal is to have a launchable MVP that fulfills the core promise of the product.
2.  **Sprint 7-8: Should-Haves & Polish**
    *   If time permits before the desired launch window, implement the highest-priority "Should-Have" feature (S1: Historical Data Sync).
    *   Otherwise, this time will be used for bug fixing, performance optimization, and preparing for app store submission.
3.  **Post-Launch: Address Remaining Scope**
    *   The remaining "Should-Have" and "Could-Have" items will form the basis of the post-launch product roadmap, to be prioritized based on user feedback and analytics.
