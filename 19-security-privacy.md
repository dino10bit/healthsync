# PRD Section 19: Data Security & Privacy Policies

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the comprehensive data security and privacy architecture for the SyncWell application. In the health data space, trust is not a feature; it is the foundation of the entire product. This document codifies our commitment to protecting user data through a "privacy-first" design philosophy and a robust, multi-layered security strategy.

This internal specification serves two purposes: it is a blueprint for the **solo developer** to implement state-of-the-art security measures, and it is a testament to **investors** of the project's deep commitment to responsible data stewardship. It is the technical foundation for the public-facing Privacy Policy.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Data Minimization:** We only request and handle data that is absolutely essential for the app's functionality.
*   **Privacy by Design:** Privacy is not an add-on. The system is architected from the ground up to protect user data.
*   **Zero Server-Side Health Data:** This is our core privacy promise. SyncWell operates as a secure, on-device data conduit. We **never** see, store, or process user health data on our servers.
*   **Radical Transparency:** We are open and honest with users about what data we handle and why.

## 3. Threat Modeling & Countermeasures

We will proactively model potential threats and define specific countermeasures.

| Threat Scenario | Description | Countermeasure(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compromised Device** | A malicious actor gains root/jailbreak access to the user's device. | - **Keychain/Keystore:** Use the most secure, hardware-backed storage for OAuth tokens. <br>- **Jailbreak/Root Detection:** The app will detect if it is running on a compromised device and may limit functionality or warn the user. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack** | An attacker on the same network intercepts traffic between the app and an API. | - **TLS 1.2+:** All network traffic is encrypted. <br>- **Certificate Pinning:** For calls to our own minimal backend, we will implement certificate pinning to ensure the app is talking to our legitimate server, not an imposter. |
| **Insecure Data Storage** | Sensitive data (tokens, settings) is stored insecurely on the device's file system. | - **Keychain/Keystore for Tokens.** <br>- **Database Encryption:** The local Realm database containing user settings will be encrypted. |
| **Vulnerable Third-Party Dependency** | A library used by the app has a known security vulnerability. | - **Automated Dependency Scanning:** The CI/CD pipeline will use Snyk to automatically scan for and flag known vulnerabilities in our dependencies. <br>- **Minimize Dependencies:** Keep the number of third-party libraries to a minimum. |

## 4. Data Flow & Classification

To ensure clarity, we classify data into three categories:

*   **Class 1: Health Data:** The user's actual health and fitness data (steps, heart rate, etc.).
    *   **Flow:** Read from a source API -> Processed in-memory on-device -> Written to a destination API.
    *   **Storage:** **NEVER** stored at rest by SyncWell.
*   **Class 2: Sensitive Credentials:** OAuth 2.0 tokens.
    *   **Flow:** Received from provider -> Stored in Keychain/Keystore -> Used for API calls.
    *   **Storage:** Exclusively in the hardware-backed Keychain/Keystore.
*   **Class 3: Configuration & Analytics Data:** User sync settings and anonymous analytics.
    *   **Flow:** Settings are created by the user and stored locally. Analytics are sent to Firebase.
    *   **Storage:** Settings are stored in the encrypted on-device database. Analytics data is stored in Firebase.

## 5. Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Process

Before any new feature that handles a new type of data is developed, a mini-PIA will be conducted by answering the following questions:
1.  What new data is being collected/processed?
2.  Why is it necessary for the feature to function?
3.  How will it be secured in transit and at rest?
4.  Will this data be shared with any new third parties?
5.  How can the user control or delete this data?
6.  Does this change require an update to the Privacy Policy?

## 6. Pre-Launch Security Audit Checklist

The following audit, based on the OWASP MASVS, will be performed before the MVP launch.

### Data Storage & Cryptography
*   [ ] All sensitive data (tokens) is stored exclusively in the Keychain/Keystore.
*   [ ] The local database is encrypted.
*   [ ] No sensitive data is written to application logs.
*   [ ] The app properly clears any sensitive data from memory after use.

### Network Communication
*   [ ] All network traffic uses TLS 1.2+.
*   [ ] Certificate pinning is correctly implemented for backend communication.

### Authentication & Authorization
*   [ ] OAuth 2.0 with PKCE is used for all cloud-based integrations.
*   [ ] The token refresh mechanism is secure.
*   [ ] The de-authorization process securely and completely deletes all relevant tokens.

### Code Quality & Build Settings
*   [ ] The app is obfuscated in production builds.
*   [ ] The app has jailbreak/root detection mechanisms.
*   [ ] All third-party dependencies have been scanned for known vulnerabilities.

## 7. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders

*   **[Diagram] Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** A detailed DFD showing the three classes of data and how they flow between the user, the mobile app, the secure storage, third-party APIs, and the minimal backend.
*   **[Table] Threat Model:** A more detailed version of the table in Section 3, including risk ratings (Probability/Impact) for each threat.
*   **[Checklist] Pre-Launch Security Audit:** A full, detailed checklist based on Section 6 that can be used to track the audit process.
