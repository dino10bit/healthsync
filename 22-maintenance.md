# PRD Section 22: Maintenance & Post-Launch Operations (SRE)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the post-launch operations and maintenance strategy for SyncWell, framed through the lens of **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**. The goal is to move beyond a reactive maintenance plan to a data-driven, proactive operational model. This ensures the long-term health, reliability, and scalability of the application, which is critical for user trust and business viability.

For the **solo developer**, adopting SRE principles provides a sustainable framework for balancing feature development with the operational load of a live service. It establishes clear, objective measures of reliability (SLOs) and a rational policy (Error Budgets) for prioritizing work, thus preventing burnout and ensuring the service remains robust.

## 2. SRE Principles for SyncWell

*   **Reliability is the Most Important Feature:** Our users trust us with their data connections. The reliability of this service is paramount.
*   **Quantify Reliability with SLOs:** We will define explicit Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for our key user journeys.
*   **Manage an Error Budget:** The SLOs will define an "error budget"â€”the acceptable level of unreliability. This budget empowers us to make data-driven decisions about when to prioritize feature development versus stability work.
*   **Automate to Reduce Toil:** We will aggressively automate repetitive operational tasks. A solo developer's time is best spent on engineering, not manual operations.

## 3. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) & Error Budgets

| User Journey | Service Level Indicator (SLI) | Service Level Objective (SLO) | Error Budget (28 days) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Data Sync** | Proportion of sync jobs that complete successfully. | **99.5%** | 0.5% of syncs can fail. |
| **App Stability** | Proportion of users who have a crash-free session. | **99.9%** | 0.1% of users can experience a crash. |
| **API Availability (External)**| Proportion of successful API calls to a specific 3rd party (e.g., Fitbit).| **99.0%** | 1.0% of API calls can fail. |

### Error Budget Policy

The error budget is the primary mechanism for prioritizing work post-launch.
*   **If the error budget is largely intact for a given month:** The developer is free to focus on the feature roadmap.
*   **If the error budget for a specific SLO is consumed:** All new feature development is **halted**. The developer's entire focus shifts to reliability work (e.g., bug fixing, improving monitoring, refactoring the problematic component) until the service is operating within its SLO again.

## 4. Incident Management (On-Call Process)

Even with one developer, a formal process for handling critical incidents is necessary.
*   **Definition of an Incident:** A "P0" incident is defined as a critical, user-impacting outage (e.g., total failure of the sync system, a critical security vulnerability, the app being pulled from an app store).
*   **Alerting:** P0 incidents will trigger high-priority alerts (e.g., via PagerDuty or a similar service) to the developer's phone.
*   **Response Protocol:**
    1.  **Acknowledge:** Acknowledge the alert immediately.
    2.  **Assess:** Quickly assess the impact and scope of the incident.
    3.  **Communicate:** Post an initial acknowledgement on a public status page or social media channel (e.g., "We are investigating an issue with Fitbit syncs. More updates to follow.").
    4.  **Mitigate:** Focus on restoring service as quickly as possible. This may involve a hotfix, disabling a specific feature, or rolling back a release.
    5.  **Postmortem:** After the incident is resolved, conduct a blameless postmortem to understand the root cause and define preventative actions.

## 5. Deployment and Patch Management

The move to a container-based architecture with AWS Fargate introduces new operational processes for deployments and security patching. These processes are designed to be highly automated to ensure reliability and reduce manual toil.

### 5.1. Backend Deployment & Rollback Process

All backend deployments will be managed through a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) that automates a **blue/green deployment** strategy, ensuring zero downtime for users.

*   **Deployment Trigger:** A new deployment is automatically triggered by a merge to the `main` branch.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Steps:**
    1.  **Build & Test:** The pipeline builds the new Docker image and runs a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.
    2.  **Scan Image:** The newly built image is scanned for known vulnerabilities using **Amazon ECR's built-in scanner**. The pipeline will fail if any `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` severity vulnerabilities are found.
    3.  **Push to ECR:** If tests and scans pass, the image is tagged with the git commit hash and pushed to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
    4.  **Deploy with CodeDeploy:** The pipeline then initiates a blue/green deployment using AWS CodeDeploy.
        *   CodeDeploy provisions a new "green" fleet of Fargate tasks with the new container image.
        *   It runs smoke tests against the green fleet to ensure it's healthy.
        *   Once validated, it shifts 100% of production traffic from the "blue" (old) fleet to the "green" (new) fleet.
        *   The old blue fleet is kept running for a configurable period (e.g., 1 hour) to allow for a near-instantaneous rollback if needed.
*   **Rollback Procedure:**
    *   **Automatic Rollback:** If the smoke tests on the green fleet fail, or if key CloudWatch alarms (e.g., high error rate) are triggered during the deployment, CodeDeploy will automatically roll back the deployment, and the blue fleet will continue to serve traffic.
    *   **Manual Rollback:** An engineer can trigger a manual rollback from the AWS console if a problem is discovered after the deployment is complete.

### 5.2. Container Patch Management

Unlike with AWS Lambda where the runtime is managed by AWS, with Fargate we are responsible for the security of our container images. This requires a proactive and automated patching strategy.

*   **Responsibility:** The engineering team is responsible for ensuring the operating system and libraries within the container images are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Automated Patching Process:** A scheduled CI/CD job will run **weekly** to perform the following:
    1.  **Pull Latest Base Image:** The pipeline pulls the latest version of our official base image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim-bullseye`).
    2.  **Rebuild Application Image:** It rebuilds our application on top of this freshly pulled base layer.
    3.  **Test and Scan:** The newly rebuilt image goes through the same rigorous testing and vulnerability scanning process as a regular feature deployment.
    4.  **Deploy:** If all checks pass, the newly patched image is deployed to production using the same blue/green deployment process described above.
*   **Rationale:** This automated weekly process ensures that we are continuously incorporating the latest OS and security patches into our production environment without requiring manual effort or intervention. It transforms security patching from a periodic, manual chore into a routine, automated part of our operations.

## 6. Maintenance & Toil Reduction

### Routine Maintenance Cadence
*   **Weekly (1-2 hours):** Review dashboards (Firebase, RevenueCat), triage support tickets and user feedback. In addition to application dependency updates, monitor the automated weekly container patching job.
*   **Monthly (2-4 hours):** Perform application-level dependency updates (e.g., Python libraries in `requirements.txt`), review and groom the technical debt registry, and review the public product roadmap.

### Technical Debt Registry
*   A formal registry of technical debt will be maintained using a specific label (e.g., `tech-debt`) in GitHub Issues.
*   Each issue will include:
    *   A description of the debt.
    *   The reason it was incurred (e.g., "a temporary workaround for a deadline").
    *   An estimate of the effort to fix it.
*   During backlog grooming, high-priority tech debt items will be scheduled into sprints just like user-facing features.
