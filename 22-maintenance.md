# PRD Section 22: Maintenance & Post-Launch Operations (SRE)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the post-launch operations and maintenance strategy for SyncWell, framed through the lens of **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**. The goal is to move beyond a reactive maintenance plan to a data-driven, proactive operational model. This ensures the long-term health, reliability, and scalability of the application, which is critical for user trust and business viability.

For the **solo developer**, adopting SRE principles provides a sustainable framework for balancing feature development with the operational load of a live service. It establishes clear, objective measures of reliability (SLOs) and a rational policy (Error Budgets) for prioritizing work, thus preventing burnout and ensuring the service remains robust.

## 2. SRE Principles for SyncWell

*   **Reliability is the Most Important Feature:** Our users trust us with their data connections. The reliability of this service is paramount.
*   **Quantify Reliability with SLOs:** We will define explicit Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for our key user journeys.
*   **Manage an Error Budget:** The SLOs will define an "error budget"â€”the acceptable level of unreliability. This budget empowers us to make data-driven decisions about when to prioritize feature development versus stability work.
*   **Automate to Reduce Toil:** We will aggressively automate repetitive operational tasks. A solo developer's time is best spent on engineering, not manual operations.

## 3. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) & Error Budgets

| User Journey | Service Level Indicator (SLI) | Service Level Objective (SLO) | Error Budget (28 days) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Data Sync** | Proportion of sync jobs that complete successfully. | **99.5%** | 0.5% of syncs can fail. |
| **App Stability** | Proportion of users who have a crash-free session. | **99.9%** | 0.1% of users can experience a crash. |
| **API Availability (External)**| Proportion of successful API calls to a specific 3rd party (e.g., Fitbit).| **99.0%** | 1.0% of API calls can fail. |

### Error Budget Policy

The error budget is the primary mechanism for prioritizing work post-launch.
*   **If the error budget is largely intact for a given month:** The developer is free to focus on the feature roadmap.
*   **If the error budget for a specific SLO is consumed:** All new feature development is **halted**. The developer's entire focus shifts to reliability work (e.g., bug fixing, improving monitoring, refactoring the problematic component) until the service is operating within its SLO again.

## 4. Incident Management (On-Call Process)

Even with one developer, a formal process for handling critical incidents is necessary.
*   **Definition of an Incident:** A "P0" incident is defined as a critical, user-impacting outage (e.g., total failure of the sync system, a critical security vulnerability, the app being pulled from an app store).
*   **Alerting:** P0 incidents will trigger high-priority alerts (e.g., via PagerDuty or a similar service) to the developer's phone.
*   **Response Protocol:**
    1.  **Acknowledge:** Acknowledge the alert immediately.
    2.  **Assess:** Quickly assess the impact and scope of the incident.
    3.  **Communicate:** Post an initial acknowledgement on a public status page or social media channel (e.g., "We are investigating an issue with Fitbit syncs. More updates to follow.").
    4.  **Mitigate:** Focus on restoring service as quickly as possible. This may involve a hotfix, disabling a specific feature, or rolling back a release.
    5.  **Postmortem:** After the incident is resolved, conduct a blameless postmortem to understand the root cause and define preventative actions.

## 5. Maintenance & Toil Reduction

### Routine Maintenance Cadence
*   **Weekly (1-2 hours):** Review dashboards (Firebase, RevenueCat), triage support tickets and user feedback.
*   **Monthly (2-4 hours):** Perform dependency updates (including security scans), review and groom the technical debt registry, and review the public product roadmap.

### Technical Debt Registry
*   A formal registry of technical debt will be maintained using a specific label (e.g., `tech-debt`) in GitHub Issues.
*   Each issue will include:
    *   A description of the debt.
    *   The reason it was incurred (e.g., "a temporary workaround for a deadline").
    *   An estimate of the effort to fix it.
*   During backlog grooming, high-priority tech debt items will be scheduled into sprints just like user-facing features.

## 6. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Chart] SLO Dashboard:** A mockup of a dashboard showing the current status of the key SLOs against their targets, with the remaining error budget clearly displayed.
*   **[Flowchart] Incident Response Flow:** A diagram showing the step-by-step process from "Alert Fires" to "Postmortem Complete."
*   **[Table] Technical Debt Registry:** A sample of the tech debt registry, showing several items with their descriptions and priority levels.
*   **[Flowchart] Decision Tree for Error Budget:** A flowchart showing the "Is the error budget consumed?" decision point and the two resulting paths: "Continue Feature Work" or "Halt Features, Focus on Reliability."
