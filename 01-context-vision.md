# PRD Section 1: Context & Vision

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic context and product vision for **SyncWell**, a cross-platform health and fitness data synchronization application for Android and iOS. In the fragmented digital health market, users often invest in multiple devices and applications (e.g., a Garmin watch for running, an Oura ring for sleep, a Fitbit for daily tracking). This creates data silos, preventing users from seeing a holistic view of their health and forcing manual, error-prone data entry. SyncWell addresses this critical pain point by providing a secure, reliable, and user-friendly "digital bridge" between these services.

Inspired by the proven market success of Health Sync, SyncWell aims to capture a significant market share by focusing on superior user experience, transparent privacy policies, and responsive, developer-led support.

The primary goal of this PRD is to provide a comprehensive, enterprise-grade roadmap. As the project will be executed by a **single engineer**, this document is structured to be highly actionable, with a strong focus on prioritization, risk mitigation, and phased implementation. It is also intended to be **investor-ready**, demonstrating a clear vision, a viable business model, and a well-defined execution strategy.

## 2. Vision & Mission

*   **Vision Statement:** To empower individuals to take full control of their digital health data, breaking down barriers between platforms to create a unified and holistic view of their personal wellness journey.
*   **Mission Statement:** To build the most reliable, secure, and user-friendly health data synchronization app on the market, backed by transparent policies and exceptional customer support.

## 3. Problem Statement

*   **For the User:** "I use multiple health apps and devices, but my data is trapped in separate ecosystems. I can't see my running data from Garmin alongside my sleep data from Oura in my preferred app, Samsung Health. Manually entering data is tedious and I lose valuable insights."
*   **For the Market:** The digital health ecosystem is fragmented. While platforms like Apple Health and Google Health Connect aim to solve this, they are not universally adopted by all app developers, and their functionality can be limited. A dedicated, third-party synchronization tool is necessary to fill the gaps.

## 4. Strategic Goals & KPIs

| Strategic Goal | Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) | Target (Year 1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Achieve Product-Market Fit** | - Onboarding Completion Rate<br>- Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate<br>- App Store Rating | - >80%<br>- >15%<br>- 4.5+ Stars |
| **Build a Sustainable Business** | - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)<br>- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)<br>- Churn Rate | - $5,000<br>- >$5<br>- <5% |
| **Deliver Best-in-Class Reliability**| - Sync Success Rate<br>- Crash-Free User Rate<br>- User-Reported Sync Errors | - >99%<br>- >99.5%<br>- <0.1% of active users/month |
| **Establish a Loyal User Base**| - DAU/MAU Ratio<br>- Support Ticket CSAT<br>- Net Promoter Score (NPS) | - >30%<br>- >90%<br>- >50 |

## 5. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements

*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Native-quality experience on both Android and iOS.
*   **Multi-App Integration:** Support data sync from a wide range of sources, including but not limited to: Samsung Health, Strava, Fitbit, Garmin Connect, Oura, Polar, Suunto, Google Fit, and Apple Health.
*   **Configurable Sync Mapping:** Users can define sync direction (source â†’ destination) for each supported data type.
*   **Automatic Background Syncing:** The app performs automatic, periodic data syncs.
*   **Historical Data Sync:** A premium feature allowing users to backfill their data history.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Reliability:** The app must ensure >99% data integrity and sync reliability. Data loss or corruption is not acceptable.
*   **Performance:** App launch time <2s. UI animations at 60fps. Background syncs must be battery-efficient and not appear on the OS's high-consumption list.
*   **Security:** All data transfer over TLS 1.2+. Sensitive tokens stored exclusively in the platform's native Keychain/Keystore. No personal health data stored on company servers.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture must be modular to support adding new integrations without degrading performance. Any backend services must be serverless and auto-scaling.
*   **Usability:** The app must be intuitive enough for a non-technical user to configure their first sync within 2 minutes of completing onboarding.

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

(This section remains largely the same as it was already comprehensive, but is included for completeness.)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-01** | A third-party API changes or is deprecated, breaking a key integration. | High | High | Implement a robust monitoring system to detect API changes. Develop a modular architecture to isolate integrations and facilitate rapid updates. |
| **R-02**| The app is rejected from the app stores due to policy violations. | Medium | High | Thoroughly review and adhere to all app store guidelines, particularly those related to health data and subscriptions. |
| **R-03**| The solo developer becomes a single point of failure (e.g., due to illness). | Low | High | Maintain comprehensive documentation and consider establishing a contingency plan with a trusted third-party developer. |
| **R-04**| The app fails to gain traction and attract a sufficient user base. | Medium | High | Focus on a core set of highly-requested integrations for the MVP. Implement a targeted marketing strategy and a generous free trial to encourage adoption. |


## 7. Execution Plan / Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Prototyping (4-6 weeks)**
    *   **Task 1.1:** Finalize technology stack (cross-platform framework, state management, database).
    *   **Task 1.2:** Develop a proof-of-concept for the core data sync engine, connecting Apple Health and Google Fit via their native APIs.
    *   **Task 1.3:** Develop a proof-of-concept for a single cloud-based API (e.g., Fitbit) to validate the OAuth flow.
    *   **Task 1.4:** Create detailed UX flow diagrams and wireframes for the core user journeys.
2.  **Phase 2: MVP Development (8-12 weeks)**
    *   **Task 2.1:** Build out the full provider architecture and implement the top 5-6 integrations.
    *   **Task 2.2:** Implement the full monetization flow (trial, IAP, subscription) and test with sandbox accounts.
    *   **Task 2.3:** Implement the Historical Data Sync feature for premium users.
    *   **Task 2.4:** Develop a comprehensive automated test suite (Unit, Integration, E2E).
    *   **Task 2.5:** Set up CI/CD pipeline, analytics, and crash reporting.
3.  **Phase 3: Launch & Iteration (Ongoing)**
    *   **Task 3.1:** Execute the release management plan for a staged rollout on both app stores.
    *   **Task 3.2:** Closely monitor KPIs and user feedback channels.
    *   **Task 3.3:** Begin executing the post-launch roadmap, prioritizing new integrations based on user votes.
