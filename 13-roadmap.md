# PRD Section 13: Roadmap, Milestones & Timeline

## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents the strategic product roadmap for SyncWell. The roadmap is a declaration of intent, organized by strategic themes and business outcomes, not a fixed list of features with deadlines. Its purpose is to provide a clear vision for the product's evolution, to guide development priorities, and to align all efforts with the overarching goal of building a sustainable and valuable business.

This is a living document that will be updated quarterly based on user feedback and data. For the **solo developer**, it provides focus and a framework for making trade-offs. For **investors**, it demonstrates a mature, outcome-oriented approach to product management.

## 2. Roadmap Philosophy

*   **Outcome-Oriented:** We prioritize desired business and user outcomes (e.g., "Increase User Trust") over a list of features. Features are simply the means to achieve those outcomes.
*   **Data-Informed, Not Data-Led:** We use analytics and user feedback to inform our priorities, but this data is combined with strategic vision. We will not simply build the most-requested feature if it does not align with our long-term strategy.
*   **Flexible and Agile:** This roadmap is not a Gantt chart. Timelines are estimates, and the plan for later quarters is intentionally less detailed. We will adapt to new information and opportunities.

## 3. Themed Product Roadmap (Year 1)

### Q1: Foundation & Launch

*   **Theme:** **Achieve a Flawless Launch.** The singular focus is on launching a stable, reliable, and trustworthy MVP that perfectly executes the core sync function for the most important platforms.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   Core Sync Engine (Must-Have)
    *   Onboarding & Core UX (Must-Have)
    *   Top 5 Platform Integrations (Must-Have)
    *   IAP & Trial Logic (Must-Have)
*   **Business Outcome:** Validate the core product-market fit.
*   **KPIs:** Onboarding Completion Rate (>80%), Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate (>10%), App Store Rating (>4.5 stars).

### Q2: User-Driven Expansion

*   **Theme:** **Listen and Respond.** The focus is on demonstrating responsiveness to the initial user base by adding the most highly-requested integrations and features.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   **Top 3 Voted Integrations:** Implement the top 3 integrations from the public feedback portal (e.g., Oura, Withings, Polar).
    *   **Historical Data Sync:** Deliver this key premium feature.
    *   **Subscription Option:** Add the 6-month subscription IAP.
*   **Business Outcome:** Increase user base and build community trust.
*   **KPIs:** User Growth Rate (20% MoM), Feature Adoption Rate (for new integrations), "Feedback-to-Feature" Cycle Time.

### Q3: Deepen the Experience

*   **Theme:** **Enhance Control and Utility.** The focus is on moving beyond basic sync to give power users more control and utility.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   **Activity Filtering:** Allow users to filter synced activities by type, duration, or distance.
    *   **Data Export/Import:** Allow users to export and import their data in standard formats (FIT/GPX).
    *   **Granular Notifications:** Add more user-configurable notification options.
*   **Business Outcome:** Increase engagement and stickiness of the product.
*   **KPIs:** DAU/MAU Ratio (>30%), Adoption of Power-User Features, Reduction in "How-To" Support Tickets.

### Q4: Global Reach & Optimization

*   **Theme:** **Expand the Market.** The focus is on growing the user base beyond the initial English-speaking market and optimizing the monetization funnel.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   **Localization (Top 3 Languages):** Translate the app and store listings into the top 3 languages identified from user analytics.
    *   **A/B Testing:** Run at least two A/B tests on the paywall (e.g., pricing, copy) to optimize conversion.
    *   **Performance Polish:** Dedicate significant time to profiling and optimizing the app's performance and battery usage.
*   **Business Outcome:** Grow revenue and expand the total addressable market.
*   **KPIs:** International User Growth, Increase in Trial Conversion Rate, Improvement in key performance metrics (e.g., app launch time).

## 4. Resource Allocation (Time Management)

As a solo developer, disciplined time allocation is crucial for balancing competing priorities. The target allocation of development time is:

*   **New Features (60%):** Work on features defined in the current quarter's roadmap theme.
*   **Maintenance & Tech Debt (25%):** Proactively refactor code, update dependencies, and improve the CI/CD pipeline. This is an investment in future velocity.
*   **Bug Fixes (15%):** Address bugs reported by users or discovered internally. This percentage may spike after a major release.

## 5. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

(This section remains largely the same but is included for completeness.)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-37** | The solo developer experiences burnout. | Medium | High | The quarterly themes and time allocation strategy are designed to create focus and a sustainable pace. It's crucial to stick to the plan and not get distracted by non-priority items. |
| **R-38** | A new competitor emerges with a significantly better product. | Medium | Medium | Stay focused on the differentiation strategy. Use the quarterly planning cycle to adapt the roadmap in response to significant market shifts. |
| **R-39** | The technical architecture does not scale well. | Low | High | The 25% allocation for maintenance and tech debt is the primary mitigation. This ensures that the foundation is continuously being strengthened. |

## 6. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders

*   **[Diagram] Themed Roadmap:** A visual, multi-lane "swimlane" diagram showing the four quarters as columns and themes/features as rows. This is more strategic than a Gantt chart.
*   **[Pie Chart] Developer Time Allocation:** A pie chart visually representing the 60/25/15 split for time management.
*   **[Diagram] OKR Tree:** A diagram showing how the quarterly themes (Objectives) break down into key features, which in turn are measured by the KPIs (Key Results).
