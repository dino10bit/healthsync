# PRD Section 13: Roadmap, Milestones & Timeline

## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents the strategic product roadmap for SyncWell. The roadmap is a declaration of intent, organized by strategic themes and business outcomes, not a fixed list of features with deadlines. Its purpose is to provide a clear vision for the product's evolution, to guide development priorities, and to align all efforts with the overarching goal of building a sustainable and valuable business.

This is a living document that will be updated quarterly based on user feedback and data. For the **solo developer**, it provides focus and a framework for making trade-offs. For **investors**, it demonstrates a mature, outcome-oriented approach to product management.

## 2. Roadmap Philosophy

*   **Outcome-Oriented:** We prioritize desired business and user outcomes (e.g., "Increase User Trust") over a list of features. Features are simply the means to achieve those outcomes.
*   **Data-Informed, Not Data-Led:** We use analytics and user feedback to inform our priorities, but this data is combined with strategic vision. We will not simply build the most-requested feature if it does not align with our long-term strategy.
*   **Flexible and Agile:** This roadmap is not a Gantt chart. Timelines are estimates, and the plan for later quarters is intentionally less detailed. We will adapt to new information and opportunities.

## 3. Themed Product Roadmap (Year 1)

This roadmap strategically rolls out the 10 core features to build a market-leading product over one year.

### Q1: Flawless Launch

*   **Theme:** **Build the Most Reliable Sync Engine on the Market.** The focus is on launching an MVP that is exceptionally stable, trustworthy, and solves the single biggest pain point: the Apple vs. Google divide.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   **The Bridge:** Seamless Apple Health & Google Fit Sync (Must-Have).
    *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Build the backend on scalable principles from day one (Must-Have).
    *   **Sync Health Dashboard:** Provide radical transparency on sync status (Must-Have).
    *   **The Holistic View:** Support for key wellness data, not just workouts (Must-Have).
    *   **Transparent Monetization:** Launch with the new Freemium model (Standard & Pro Tiers) (Must-Have).
*   **Business Outcome:** Establish SyncWell as the most reliable and trustworthy sync tool and validate the core value proposition.
*   **KPIs:** Sync Success Rate (>99.9%), Backend API Uptime (>99.95%), App Store Rating (>4.7 Stars).

### Q2: Intelligence & Insight

*   **Theme:** **Go Beyond Syncing to Intelligent Data Management.** The focus is on introducing smart features that actively solve data-quality problems for users, creating major differentiation.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   **Smart Conflict Resolution Engine:** Intelligently merge duplicate activities (Should-Have). This will be the flagship "Pro" feature for the quarter.
    *   **The Recovery Sync:** Allow Pro users to import their complete history (Should-Have).
    *   **Top Voted Integration:** Add the #1 most-requested new service from user feedback.
*   **Business Outcome:** Drive conversion to the "Pro" tier by delivering features that provide immense and obvious value.
*   **KPIs:** Free-to-Pro Conversion Rate, Adoption Rate of Conflict Resolution Feature, User CSAT.

### Q3: Automation & Control

*   **Theme:** **Give Power Users Unprecedented Control.** The focus is on building out the "Pro" feature set to cater to our most demanding and valuable users.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   **Pro-Tier Power User Tools:** Introduce advanced data editing and rule-based merging capabilities (Should-Have).
    *   **Pre-Sync Preview:** Give users the option to approve changes before they happen, a huge trust-builder (Could-Have).
    *   **Another Top Voted Integration:** Continue to expand the ecosystem based on user feedback.
*   **Business Outcome:** Increase ARPU and reduce churn by making the Pro tier indispensable for power users.
*   **KPIs:** Pro Tier Churn Rate (<2%), Adoption of Power User Tools, Increase in LTV.

### Q4: Scale & Optimize

*   **Theme:** **Grow the User Base and Optimize for the Future.** With a mature and feature-rich product, the focus shifts to expanding the user base and ensuring long-term technical health.
*   **Key Features / Epics:**
    *   **Family Health Plan:** Introduce the family subscription model to grow the user base and revenue (Could-Have).
    *   **Architectural Polish:** Dedicate a "hardening" sprint to pay down tech debt and conduct rigorous load testing to ensure the platform is ready for the next 10 million users.
    *   **A/B Testing the Onboarding:** Run tests to optimize the flow for converting new free users into happy Pro customers.
*   **Business Outcome:** Accelerate user growth and ensure the platform is robust and scalable for years to come.
*   **KPIs:** Number of Active Family Plan subscriptions, Reduction in Average Sync Latency, Improvement in key Onboarding funnel metrics.

## 4. Resource Allocation (Time Management)

As a solo developer, disciplined time allocation is crucial for balancing competing priorities. The target allocation of development time is:

*   **New Features (60%):** Work on features defined in the current quarter's roadmap theme.
*   **Maintenance & Tech Debt (25%):** Proactively refactor code, update dependencies, and improve the CI/CD pipeline. This is an investment in future velocity.
*   **Bug Fixes (15%):** Address bugs reported by users or discovered internally. This percentage may spike after a major release.

## 5. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

(This section remains largely the same but is included for completeness.)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-37** | The solo developer experiences burnout. | Medium | High | The quarterly themes and time allocation strategy are designed to create focus and a sustainable pace. It's crucial to stick to the plan and not get distracted by non-priority items. |
| **R-38** | A new competitor emerges with a significantly better product. | Medium | Medium | Stay focused on the differentiation strategy. Use the quarterly planning cycle to adapt the roadmap in response to significant market shifts. |
| **R-39** | The technical architecture does not scale well. | Low | High | The 25% allocation for maintenance and tech debt is the primary mitigation. This ensures that the foundation is continuously being strengthened. |

## 6. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders

*   **[Diagram] Themed Roadmap:** A visual, multi-lane "swimlane" diagram showing the four quarters as columns and themes/features as rows. This is more strategic than a Gantt chart.
*   **[Pie Chart] Developer Time Allocation:** A pie chart visually representing the 60/25/15 split for time management.
*   **[Diagram] OKR Tree:** A diagram showing how the quarterly themes (Objectives) break down into key features, which in turn are measured by the KPIs (Key Results).
