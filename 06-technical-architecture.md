# PRD Section 6: Technical Architecture, Security & Compliance

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the complete technical architecture for the SyncWell application. The architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable, adhering to modern software engineering principles while being pragmatic for implementation by a **solo developer**.

We will use the **C4 Model** as a framework to describe the architecture at different levels of detail, ensuring clarity for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The core architectural principles are **modularity** (via a Provider-based pattern), **security by design**, and **privacy by default**. This document is the master blueprint for the system's construction.

## 2. Architectural Model (C4)

### Level 1: System Context

This diagram shows the system in its environment, illustrating its relationship with users and external systems.

*   **System:** The **SyncWell Application System**.
*   **Users:**
    *   **Health-Conscious User:** Interacts with the SyncWell Mobile App to configure syncs and manage their data connections.
*   **External Systems:**
    *   **Third-Party Health Platforms** (e.g., Garmin Connect, Fitbit API, Strava API): The primary systems SyncWell reads data from and writes data to.
    *   **Platform App Stores** (Apple App Store, Google Play Store): Used for application distribution and handling in-app purchases.
    *   **Platform Notification Services** (APNs, FCM): Used to send push notifications.
    *   **Platform Backup Services** (iCloud, Google Drive Auto-Backup): Used for backing up user settings.

### Level 2: Containers

This level zooms into the system boundary to show the high-level technical containers designed to operate at massive scale.

1.  **Mobile Application (Kotlin Multiplatform & Native UI)**
    *   **Description:** The user-facing application that runs on the user's iOS or Android device. It contains the UI and presentation logic.
    *   **Technology:** Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) for shared business logic, with native UI for each platform (SwiftUI for iOS, Jetpack Compose for Android).
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Provides a high-performance, native User Interface.
        *   Delegates all business logic to the shared KMP module.
        *   Securely stores user credentials (OAuth tokens) on the device.
        *   Initiates sync requests to the backend.
2.  **Scalable Serverless Backend (AWS)**
    *   **Description:** An event-driven, serverless backend on Amazon Web Services, designed to handle millions of users and high request volumes. It does **not** store or process any raw user health data.
    *   **Technology:** AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon SQS, Amazon DynamoDB.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   **API Gateway:** Provides a secure, scalable HTTP endpoint for the mobile app to request syncs.
        *   **Request Lambda:** A function that validates sync requests and places them as jobs into an SQS queue. This provides a fast (<50ms) response to the user.
        *   **SQS Queue:** A highly durable and scalable queue that decouples the request from the processing. It ensures that no sync jobs are lost, even during massive load spikes.
        *   **Worker Lambdas:** A fleet of functions that pull jobs from the SQS queue and execute the actual third-party API calls. This is where the core sync logic, including the **Conflict Resolution Engine**, runs.
        *   **DynamoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing user configuration, sync state, and metadata with single-digit millisecond latency.

### Level 3: Components (Inside the KMP Shared Module)

This level zooms into the shared business logic module that runs on both iOS and Android.

*   **`SyncManager`:** The core orchestrator for the sync process.
*   **`ConflictResolutionEngine`:** A dedicated component for detecting and resolving data conflicts based on user-defined rules.
*   **`ProviderManager`:** Responsible for loading and managing the different `DataProvider` modules.
*   **`DataProvider (Interface)`:** A standardized interface for all third-party integrations (Fitbit, Garmin, etc.).
*   **`ApiClient`:** A robust HTTP client for making API calls to the SyncWell backend and third-party services.
*   **`SecureStorageWrapper`:** An abstraction over the native Keychain/Keystore for securely storing and retrieving sensitive data like OAuth tokens.
*   **`SettingsRepository`:** Manages user settings and preferences, storing them on-device.

## 3. Technology Stack & Rationale

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cross-Platform Framework** | **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** | **Performance & Native Feel.** KMP allows sharing the complex business logic (sync engine, data providers) in a common Kotlin codebase while building the UI with the platform's native tools (SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose). This provides the best possible performance and user experience, which is critical for a high-reliability app. |
| **State Management** | **Platform-Native (SwiftUI/Combine, Jetpack Compose/Flow)** | **Simplicity & Performance.** By using native UI, we can leverage the modern, reactive state management patterns built into each platform. This reduces complexity and avoids the overhead of a third-party state management library. |
| **On-Device Database** | **SQLDelight** | **Cross-Platform & Type-Safe.** SQLDelight is a KMP-native library that generates type-safe Kotlin APIs from SQL statements. This ensures data consistency and reliability across both iOS and Android. |
| **Serverless Backend** | **AWS (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB)** | **Massive Scalability & Reliability.** This event-driven architecture is the industry standard for building highly scalable applications. It is designed to meet our targets of 1M DAU and 10,000 RPS, offering virtually unlimited scale with pay-per-use cost efficiency. |
| **API Client** | **Ktor** | **Kotlin-Native & Multiplatform.** Ktor is a modern, coroutine-based HTTP client that is designed for Kotlin and works seamlessly in a KMP environment, simplifying the networking code. |

## 4. Security & Compliance

### Security Measures

*   **Data Encryption in Transit:** All network traffic will use TLS 1.2+. **Certificate Pinning** will be implemented for all API calls made from the mobile app to our own backend services to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Data Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive credentials will be stored exclusively in the native Keychain (iOS) and Keystore (Android). The local Realm database will be encrypted.
*   **Code Security:** Production builds will be obfuscated. A dependency scanner (Snyk) will be run in the CI/CD pipeline to check for vulnerabilities.

### Compliance
*   The architecture is designed to facilitate compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and all relevant platform policies by ensuring that no personal health data is ever stored on servers controlled by SyncWell. All user data processing happens on the user's device.
