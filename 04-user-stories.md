# PRD Section 4: User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

## 1. Executive Summary

This document translates the product scope into a backlog of actionable user stories for the SyncWell MVP. Each story is crafted from the perspective of our user personas and is accompanied by detailed, testable acceptance criteria. This structured approach ensures that development efforts are directly tied to user needs and business value.

For the **solo developer**, this document serves as the primary "to-do list" for building the MVP. The detailed acceptance criteria provide a clear definition of "done" for each task, reducing ambiguity and ensuring the final product aligns with the strategic vision. The stories are prioritized according to the MoSCoW framework defined in `02-product-scope.md`.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### AC for US-02:
*   **Given** I am a new user who has just completed the intro screens
*   **When** I am on the "Connect Apps" screen
*   **Then** I see a list of supported source and destination apps.
*   **And** when I select a source app (e.g., Fitbit), I am taken through the official Fitbit OAuth web flow.
*   **And** upon successful login, I am returned to the app.
*   **And** the app now shows Fitbit as a connected source.
*   **And** the process repeats seamlessly for the destination app (e.g., Google Fit).

### AC for US-04:
*   **Given** I have at least one source and one destination app connected
*   **When** I tap the "Add New Sync" button
*   **Then** I am taken to the configuration screen.
*   **And** I can select "Fitbit" as my source, "Google Fit" as my destination, and "Steps" as the data type.
*   **And** when I save the configuration, I am returned to the dashboard.
*   **And** I see a new entry on my dashboard that says "Fitbit Steps â†’ Google Fit".

### AC for US-05:
*   **Given** a user has a valid, active sync configuration
*   **When** new data is added to the source app
*   **Then** the SyncWell background process should trigger within the OS-defined window (e.g., ~15-30 mins).
*   **And** the new data should be successfully transferred to the destination app without the user opening SyncWell.

### AC for US-09:
*   **Given** my 7-day trial has expired
*   **When** I open the app
*   **Then** I am presented with a paywall screen.
*   **And** the screen clearly shows the price and benefits of the Lifetime License.
*   **And** when I tap "Purchase," the native iOS/Android purchase flow is initiated.
*   **And** upon successful payment, the paywall is dismissed and the app is fully unlocked.

### AC for US-10:
*   **Given** I am a premium user
*   **When** I navigate to the "Historical Sync" screen
*   **Then** I can select a start date and an end date.
*   **And** when I initiate the sync, the app provides clear feedback that the process has started and may take a long time.
*   **And** the app processes the historical data in the background, one day at a time, without blocking the main UI.
