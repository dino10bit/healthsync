# PRD Section 4: User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

## 1. Executive Summary

This document translates the product scope into a backlog of actionable user stories for the SyncWell MVP. Each story is crafted from the perspective of our user personas and is accompanied by detailed, testable acceptance criteria. This structured approach ensures that development efforts are directly tied to user needs and business value.

For the **solo developer**, this document serves as the primary "to-do list" for building the MVP. The detailed acceptance criteria provide a clear definition of "done" for each task, reducing ambiguity and ensuring the final product aligns with the strategic vision. The stories are prioritized according to the MoSCoW framework defined in `02-product-scope.md`.

## 2. MVP User Story Backlog

### Epic 1: First-Time User Experience & Onboarding

---

#### **US-01:** See a brief, clear overview of the app's value proposition.
*   **User Story:** As a new user (Alex), I want to see a brief, clear overview of what the app does so that I can understand its value proposition immediately.
*   **Persona:** Alex, Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-4)
*   **Story Pts:** 2

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am a new user launching the app for the very first time.
    *   **When** the app opens, I am presented with a welcome carousel.
    *   **Then** the carousel should consist of exactly three screens.
    *   **And** the first screen clearly states the main value proposition: "All Your Health Data, in Sync."
    *   **And** the second screen clearly states the privacy policy: "Your Data is Yours. We never see, store, or sell your personal health information." and provides a tappable link to the full Privacy Policy.
    *   **And** the third screen contains a single, prominent "Begin Setup" button.
    *   **And** I can swipe left/right to navigate between the screens, and corresponding page indicators (dots) are displayed.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The welcome carousel will be implemented using a native `ViewPager` (Android) or `UIPageViewController` (iOS).
    *   The completion of the onboarding carousel should be stored in `SharedPreferences` / `UserDefaults` so it is not shown on subsequent app launches.
    *   The Privacy Policy link should open in an in-app browser (`SFSafariViewController` or Chrome Custom Tabs).

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The design should be clean, with minimal text and engaging graphics or icons.
    *   The "Begin Setup" button must be the most prominent element on the final screen.
    *   Refer to: `08-ux-onboarding.md`, Section 3, Step 1.
    *   Required Diagram: `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` - "New User Onboarding Flow".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: onboarding_started` - Fired when the user sees the first screen of the carousel.
    *   `event: onboarding_privacy_policy_viewed` - Fired when the user taps the privacy policy link.
    *   `event: onboarding_completed` - Fired when the user taps the "Begin Setup" button.

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-22:** "The onboarding flow is confusing or too long, causing a high drop-off rate." - Mitigation: The flow is intentionally brief and focused on value. Analytics will track the funnel conversion rate.

---

#### **US-02:** Be guided through connecting the first two health apps.
*   **User Story:** As a new user (Sarah), I want a simple, guided process to connect my first two health apps so that I can get set up with minimal friction.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-4)
*   **Story Pts:** 5

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I have completed the welcome carousel (US-01).
    *   **When** I am on the "Choose Source App" screen.
    *   **Then** I see a grid of logos for supported source apps.
    *   **And** when I select a source app (e.g., Fitbit), the official OAuth 2.0 login flow for that app is presented in a secure `WebView`.
    *   **And** upon successful authorization, I am returned to the app.
    *   **And** the app transitions me to the "Choose Destination App" screen.
    *   **And** I see a grid of logos for supported destination apps.
    *   **And** when I select a destination app (e.g., Google Fit), I am prompted for the necessary Health Platform permissions (see US-03).
    *   **And** upon granting permissions, the app shows both apps as "Connected" and proceeds to the first sync configuration (US-04).
    *   **Scenario: OAuth Login Fails**
        *   **Given** I am in the OAuth `WebView`.
        *   **When** I enter incorrect credentials or cancel the login.
        *   **Then** I am returned to the "Choose Source App" screen and a non-blocking toast/snackbar message appears, saying "Authorization failed. Please try again."

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   OAuth 2.0 logic must securely handle the authorization code flow, storing tokens in the platform's secure storage (`Keystore` / `Keychain`).
    *   The list of source/destination apps should be remotely configurable (e.g., via Firebase Remote Config) to allow for future additions without an app update.
    *   A state machine should manage the onboarding flow state (`AWAITING_SOURCE_AUTH`, `AWAITING_DESTINATION_AUTH`, etc.).

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The currently selected source/destination should be visually highlighted.
    *   Loading indicators should be displayed during the OAuth process.
    *   Refer to: `08-ux-onboarding.md`, Section 3, Steps 3-6.
    *   Required Diagram: `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` - "New User Onboarding Flow".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: source_app_selected`, `property: app_name` (e.g., 'Fitbit')
    *   `event: source_app_auth_success`
    *   `event: source_app_auth_failed`
    *   `event: destination_app_selected`, `property: app_name` (e.g., 'Google Fit')
    *   `event: destination_app_auth_success`
    *   `event: destination_app_auth_failed`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-22:** High drop-off rate. Mitigation: Analytics will pinpoint the failing step.
    *   **R-104:** Implementation deviates from the flow. Mitigation: The clickable prototype is the source of truth.

---

#### **US-03:** Be clearly informed about permission requests.
*   **User Story:** As a new user (Alex), I want the app to clearly request necessary permissions (e.g., for HealthKit) and explain why they are needed so that I feel secure.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-4)
*   **Story Pts:** 2

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am about to be shown a system-level permission dialog (e.g., Notifications, HealthKit/Google Fit).
    *   **When** the action that requires the permission is triggered.
    *   **Then** the app first displays a friendly, in-app "pre-permission" dialog.
    *   **And** this dialog clearly explains *what* permission is needed and *why* it's needed (e.g., "Allow notifications so we can alert you if a sync fails.").
    *   **And** the pre-permission dialog has two buttons: a positive action ("Yes, Notify Me") and a negative action ("Not Now").
    *   **And** if I tap the positive action, the native OS permission dialog is triggered immediately.
    *   **And** if I tap the negative action, the dialog is dismissed, and the native dialog is *not* shown.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   Create a reusable "Permission Priming" component that can be configured for different permission types (Notifications, Health data).
    *   The app must correctly handle the case where a user has previously denied a permission and guide them to the system settings if they want to enable it later.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The language used in the priming dialog should be user-friendly and benefit-oriented, not technical.
    *   Refer to: `08-ux-onboarding.md`, Section 3, Step 2.
    *   Required Diagram: `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` - The "Error State & Recovery Flow" should include the path for re-requesting permissions.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: permission_priming_shown`, `property: permission_type` (e.g., 'notifications')
    *   `event: permission_priming_accepted`
    *   `event: permission_priming_declined`
    *   `event: permission_os_dialog_granted`
    *   `event: permission_os_dialog_denied`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   Users may still deny permissions. Mitigation: The priming dialog is the best practice for increasing the grant rate. The app must function gracefully (with reduced capability) if permissions are denied.

---

### Epic 2: Core Sync Configuration & Management

---

#### **US-04:** Configure a new data sync with full control.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Alex), I want to configure a sync from a source app to a destination app for a specific data type so that I have full control over my data flow.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-5)
*   **Story Pts:** 5

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am on the Main Dashboard and have at least one source and one destination app connected.
    *   **When** I tap the "+" Floating Action Button.
    *   **Then** I am taken to the "Sync Configuration" screen.
    *   **And** the flow consists of four steps: Choose Data Type, Choose Source, Choose Destination, Review & Save.
    *   **And** in Step 1, I can select one or more data types (e.g., "Steps", "Sleep").
    *   **And** in Step 2, I can select a connected source app.
    *   **And** in Step 3, I can select a connected destination app. Invalid destinations (like the selected source app) are grayed out.
    *   **And** in Step 4, I see a summary of my choices (e.g., "Sync Steps, Sleep from Fitbit to Google Fit").
    *   **And** when I tap "Save Sync," the new configuration is saved, and I am returned to the dashboard.
    *   **And** a new "Sync Card" representing this configuration appears on the dashboard.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The sync configuration should be stored locally in a structured database (e.g., SQLite/Room, Core Data).
    *   The configuration model must support multiple data types per sync connection.
    *   The logic for graying out invalid destinations must be robust and consider platform limitations (e.g., Garmin as write-only). See `32-platform-limitations.md`.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The multi-step process should have clear progress indicators.
    *   The selection of data types should be a multi-select list, while source/destination selection should be single-select.
    *   Refer to: `09-ux-configuration.md`, Section 3.2.
    *   Required Diagram: `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` - "Add New Sync Configuration Flow".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: add_sync_started`
    *   `event: add_sync_datatypes_selected`, `property: count`
    *   `event: add_sync_source_selected`, `property: app_name`
    *   `event: add_sync_destination_selected`, `property: app_name`
    *   `event: add_sync_completed`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-26:** "Users misunderstand the configuration options." - Mitigation: The step-by-step flow and visual cues (grayed-out options) are designed to prevent user error.

---

#### **US-05:** Have data sync automatically in the background.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Sarah), I want my data to sync automatically in the background so that my data is always up-to-date without any manual effort.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-1)
*   **Story Pts:** 8

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I have at least one active sync configuration.
    *   **When** new data is generated in the source application.
    *   **Then** a background sync job is triggered by the operating system.
    *   **And** the job fetches new data from the source app's API.
    *   **And** the job transforms the data into the destination app's format.
    *   **And** the job writes the transformed data to the destination app's API.
    *   **And** this entire process happens without me needing to open the app.
    *   **And** the "Last Synced" timestamp on the dashboard is updated upon successful completion.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   This is the core feature. Implementation will use `WorkManager` on Android and `BGAppRefreshTask` on iOS.
    *   The background task must be efficient and respect OS-imposed time limits.
    *   It needs robust error handling and retry logic (e.g., exponential backoff for network errors). See `17-error-handling.md`.
    *   The sync logic must be idempotent to prevent duplicate data entries on retries.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The user needs to be notified if background sync fails repeatedly and requires their intervention (e.g., re-authentication). This is a critical feedback loop.
    *   Refer to: `05-data-sync.md`.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: background_sync_job_started`, `property: trigger` (e.g., 'periodic', 'os_push')
    *   `event: background_sync_job_completed`, `property: status` (e.g., 'success', 'failure'), `property: items_synced`
    *   `event: background_sync_job_failed`, `property: error_code`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   Platform-specific restrictions on background tasks can make syncing unreliable. Mitigation: Thoroughly test on various OS versions and devices. Clearly communicate limitations to the user.

---

#### **US-06:** Manually trigger a sync from the main dashboard.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Alex), I want to be able to manually trigger a sync from the main dashboard so that I can see my latest data on demand.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-5)
*   **Story Pts:** 3

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am on the Main Dashboard with an active Sync Card.
    *   **When** I perform a "pull-to-refresh" gesture on the list of syncs.
    *   **Then** a refresh indicator appears.
    *   **And** the status text on all Sync Cards changes to "Syncing...".
    *   **And** a foreground sync process is initiated for all active configurations.
    *   **And** upon completion, the status text updates to the latest sync time (e.g., "Synced just now") or an error state.
    *   **And** the refresh indicator disappears.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The manual sync should reuse the same core sync logic as the background task but run in a foreground service to ensure it completes.
    *   The UI must be updated in real-time to reflect the state of the sync (syncing, success, failure).

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The pull-to-refresh gesture is an industry standard and provides a good user experience for this action.
    *   Each Sync Card should individually update its status, not wait for all syncs to complete.
    *   Refer to: `09-ux-configuration.md`, Section 3.1.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: manual_sync_triggered`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   N/A - This is a straightforward feature with low risk.

---

#### **US-07:** Easily view the status of sync connections.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Sarah), I want to be able to easily view the status of my sync connections (e.g., "Last synced 5 mins ago", "Error") so that I can trust the app is working.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-5)
*   **Story Pts:** 3

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am on the Main Dashboard.
    *   **When** a sync has recently completed successfully.
    *   **Then** the corresponding Sync Card displays status text like "Synced 5 minutes ago" in a default/green color.
    *   **When** a sync is currently in progress.
    *   **Then** the Sync Card displays "Syncing..." and an animated progress indicator.
    *   **When** a sync has failed and requires user action (e.g., re-authentication).
    *   **Then** the Sync Card displays "Needs attention" in a warning/red color, and the card itself may have a colored border.
    *   **When** a sync has failed with a temporary error.
    *   **Then** the Sync Card displays "Sync failed. Will retry."

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The state of each sync (idle, syncing, success, error) must be persisted in the local database.
    *   A `StateFlow` or `LiveData` object should expose the list of sync configurations and their states to the UI, so it updates automatically.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   Color should be used to draw attention to error states, but it must be accompanied by clear text for accessibility.
    *   Tapping on a card in an error state should navigate the user to a screen with more details and a path to resolution. See `40-error-recovery.md`.
    *   Refer to: `09-ux-configuration.md`, Section 3.1, "Sync Card".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: sync_status_viewed`, `property: status` (e.g., 'success', 'error_needs_auth')

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-27:** "The app fails to properly save or reflect the user's configuration changes." - Mitigation: Use a robust reactive state management library to ensure the UI is always a direct reflection of the database state.

---

#### **US-08:** Delete a sync configuration that is no longer needed.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Alex), I want to be able to delete a sync configuration that I no longer need so that I can keep my dashboard tidy.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-5)
*   **Story Pts:** 2

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am on the Main Dashboard with an existing Sync Card.
    *   **When** I tap the "three-dots" context menu on the Sync Card.
    *   **Then** a menu appears with a "Delete" option.
    *   **And** when I tap "Delete," a confirmation dialog appears with the title "Delete Sync?" and message "Are you sure you want to delete this sync? This cannot be undone."
    *   **And** the dialog has "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons.
    *   **And** if I tap "Delete," the Sync Card is removed from the dashboard, and the underlying configuration is deleted from the database.
    *   **And** if I tap "Cancel," the dialog is dismissed, and no change is made.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The deletion should cascade, removing the configuration from the local database and cancelling any pending background jobs associated with it.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   A confirmation dialog is crucial to prevent accidental deletion.
    *   The animation of the card being removed from the list should be smooth.
    *   Refer to: `09-ux-configuration.md`, Section 3.1, "Sync Card".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: sync_delete_initiated`
    *   `event: sync_delete_confirmed`
    *   `event: sync_delete_cancelled`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   Accidental deletion. Mitigation: The confirmation dialog is the standard and effective mitigation for this.

### Epic 3: Monetization & Premium Features

---

#### **US-09:** Purchase the lifetime license to unlock the full app.
*   **User Story:** As a trial user (Sarah), I want a clear and simple way to purchase the lifetime license so that I can continue using the app after my trial ends.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-7)
*   **Story Pts:** 5

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** my 7-day free trial has expired.
    *   **When** I open the app.
    *   **Then** I am presented with a blocking paywall screen.
    *   **And** the paywall screen clearly states the benefits of the Pro license and the one-time purchase price.
    *   **And** when I tap the "Unlock Pro" button, the native iOS/Android purchase flow is initiated.
    *   **And** upon successful payment, the paywall is dismissed, and the app becomes fully functional.
    *   **Scenario: Purchase Fails**
        *   **Given** I am in the native purchase flow.
        *   **When** the purchase fails (e.g., payment declined, network error).
        *   **Then** I am returned to the paywall screen, and a non-blocking error message is displayed (e.g., "Purchase failed. Please try again.").

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   Integrate with the native In-App Purchase APIs (StoreKit for iOS, Google Play Billing for Android).
    *   The purchase state (entitlement) must be securely stored and verified.
    *   The server-side receipt validation is recommended to prevent spoofing.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The paywall should be visually appealing and clearly communicate the value proposition of upgrading.
    *   It should include a link to the terms of service and privacy policy.
    *   Refer to: `12-trial-subscription.md`.
    *   Required Diagram: `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` - "Monetization & Purchase Flow".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: paywall_shown`, `property: trigger` (e.g., 'trial_expired', 'feature_gate')
    *   `event: purchase_initiated`
    *   `event: purchase_completed`, `property: revenue`
    *   `event: purchase_failed`, `property: error_code`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-24:** "The value proposition of the Pro tier is not clearly communicated." - Mitigation: The paywall must list the key benefits (e.g., "Unlimited Syncs", "Historical Sync", "Conflict Resolution").

---

#### **US-10:** Sync historical data to get a complete health history.
*   **User Story:** As a premium user (Alex), I want to sync my past health data by selecting a date range so that I can have a complete, unified history of my activities.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Should-Have (S-1)
*   **Story Pts:** 8

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am a premium user.
    *   **When** I navigate to the "Historical Sync" feature from the settings screen.
    *   **Then** I am presented with a screen where I can select a start date and an end date for the sync.
    *   **And** when I initiate the sync, a confirmation dialog appears, warning me that the process may take a long time and consume significant battery.
    *   **And** after confirming, the app begins fetching and syncing data for the selected date range in the background.
    *   **And** the UI provides clear, persistent feedback on the progress (e.g., "Syncing 3 of 90 days...").
    *   **Scenario: Free user attempts access**
        *   **Given** I am a free user.
        *   **When** I attempt to access the "Historical Sync" feature.
        *   **Then** I am shown a paywall screen explaining the feature and prompting me to upgrade (see US-17).

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   This task must be run in a long-running foreground service to prevent the OS from killing it.
    *   The process must be pausable and resumable. State (e.g., the last successfully synced day) must be persisted.
    *   The process should fetch data in small chunks (e.g., one day at a time) to manage memory and network usage.
    *   Rate limiting for third-party APIs must be respected.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The progress indicator is critical for user trust. It must not block the rest of the UI.
    *   A notification should be posted to inform the user when the long-running task is complete.
    *   Refer to: `02-product-scope.md`, S1.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: historical_sync_gate_shown` (for free users)
    *   `event: historical_sync_started`, `property: date_range_days`
    *   `event: historical_sync_completed`
    *   `event: historical_sync_paused`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   High battery and data consumption. Mitigation: The warning dialog is essential. The process should also be configured to run only when the device is charging, if possible.

---

#### **US-11:** Restore a previous purchase on a new device.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Sarah), I want a "Restore Purchases" button so that I can easily activate my license on a new phone.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-7)
*   **Story Pts:** 3

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I have previously purchased the lifetime license.
    *   **When** I install the app on a new device using the same App Store / Play Store account.
    *   **Then** I see a "Restore Purchases" button on the paywall screen and in the Settings menu.
    *   **And** when I tap the button, the app communicates with the store API to check for existing purchases.
    *   **And** my previous lifetime license is detected and applied to the new installation.
    *   **And** the app is fully unlocked.
    *   **Scenario: No Purchase to Restore**
        *   **When** I tap "Restore Purchases" but have no previous purchase.
        *   **Then** a message is displayed: "No previous purchase found."

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   This uses the standard `restorePurchases` functionality of the StoreKit and Google Play Billing libraries.
    *   The app must be able to handle the case where the user is logged into a different store account than the one used for the original purchase.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The "Restore Purchases" button must be clearly visible on the paywall so users don't accidentally re-purchase.
    *   Refer to: `12-trial-subscription.md`.
    *   Required Diagram: `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` - "Monetization & Purchase Flow".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: restore_purchase_initiated`
    *   `event: restore_purchase_success`
    *   `event: restore_purchase_failed_no_purchase`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   Users being unable to restore their purchase is a major point of frustration. Mitigation: This is a standard, well-documented flow. Thorough testing is key.

---

### Epic 4: Support & Settings

---

#### **US-12:** Find answers to common questions in an in-app Help Center.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Sarah), I want to find answers to common questions in an in-app Help Center so that I can solve problems myself without contacting support.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-7)
*   **Story Pts:** 3

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am in the app.
    *   **When** I navigate to the "Settings" screen and tap "Help Center."
    *   **Then** I am presented with a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs).
    *   **And** each FAQ can be tapped to expand and view the answer.
    *   **And** the Help Center contains a link to the public feature request portal (Canny.io).
    *   **And** the Help Center contains a "Contact Support" button that opens the user's default email client with a pre-filled "To" address and subject line.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The FAQ content should be remotely configurable (e.g., fetched from a JSON file on a server) so it can be updated without an app release.
    *   The link to the feature request portal should open in an embedded `WebView`.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The Help Center should be searchable if the number of FAQs grows beyond 10-15.
    *   The UI should be a simple, clean, expandable list.
    *   Refer to: `10-ux-feedback.md`, `24-user-support.md`.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: help_center_viewed`
    *   `event: help_center_faq_opened`, `property: question`
    *   `event: help_center_contact_support_tapped`
    *   `event: help_center_feature_requests_tapped`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-28:** "The volume of feedback becomes too high." - Mitigation: The Help Center and FAQ serve as the first line of defense, deflecting common queries from becoming support tickets.

#### **US-13:** De-authorize a connected app and delete credentials.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Alex), I want to be able to de-authorize a connected app and have all my credentials for it securely deleted so that I have full control over my privacy.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-5)
*   **Story Pts:** 3

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I have at least one app connected.
    *   **When** I navigate to "Settings" -> "Connected Apps."
    *   **Then** I see a list of my connected applications.
    *   **And** each application in the list has a "Disconnect" button.
    *   **When** I tap "Disconnect" for a specific app (e.g., Fitbit).
    *   **Then** a confirmation dialog appears, warning me that this will delete the connection and all associated sync configurations.
    *   **And** if I confirm, the app makes an API call to revoke the OAuth token.
    *   **And** all stored credentials (access token, refresh token) for that app are permanently deleted from the device's secure storage.
    *   **And** all sync configurations using that app are deleted from the dashboard.
    *   **And** the app is removed from the "Connected Apps" list.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The de-authorization process must call the `revoke` endpoint of the respective service's API, if available.
    *   Credentials must be deleted from `Keystore` / `Keychain`.
    *   The deletion of sync configurations must cascade correctly in the local database.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The confirmation dialog is critical to prevent accidental disconnection.
    *   A loading indicator should be shown while the de-authorization is in progress.
    *   Refer to: `09-ux-configuration.md`, Section 3.3; `36-user-privacy-settings.md`.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: app_disconnect_initiated`, `property: app_name`
    *   `event: app_disconnect_confirmed`
    *   `event: app_disconnect_cancelled`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   Failing to properly revoke the token on the server-side could leave a security hole. Mitigation: Ensure the API calls are implemented correctly and test that the token is actually invalidated.

### Epic 5: Strategic Differentiators & Pro Features

---

#### **US-14:** Sync data between Apple Health and Google Fit.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Alex) with both an iPhone and an Android tablet, I want to sync my Apple Health data to Google Fit so I can see my complete health picture on both devices.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-2)
*   **Story Pts:** 13

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I have connected Apple Health as a source on my iPhone.
    *   **And** I have connected Google Fit as a destination on the same phone.
    *   **When** a sync is configured and runs.
    *   **Then** data from Apple Health (e.g., Steps, Weight) is successfully written to my Google Fit account.
    *   **And** the same is true for the reverse (Google Fit to Apple Health).

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   This is a cornerstone feature. It requires deep integration with both HealthKit (iOS) and Health Connect (Android).
    *   The data models for Apple Health and Google Fit are different and require a robust mapping layer. This mapping logic should be well-documented and tested.
    *   This feature is the primary reason for the Event-Driven Architecture mentioned in `02-product-scope.md`.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The user must be clearly informed about which data types are supported for this cross-platform sync, as there may not be 1:1 parity.
    *   Refer to: `02-product-scope.md`, M2.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: cross_platform_sync_completed`, `property: source` ('apple'), `property: destination` ('google')

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   Complexity of mapping data between the two ecosystems. Mitigation: Start with a limited set of the most common data types (Steps, Weight, Heart Rate) and expand from there.

---

#### **US-15:** Automatically detect and merge duplicate activities.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Alex) who records a run on both their Garmin watch and Peloton bike, I want the app to automatically detect the duplicate and offer to merge them into one activity so my stats aren't counted twice.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Should-Have (S-2)
*   **Story Pts:** 13

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am a Pro user.
    *   **And** I have recorded the same activity in two different source apps (e.g., a run in Garmin and Peloton).
    *   **When** the next sync runs.
    *   **Then** the app identifies that the two activities are duplicates based on time overlap and activity type.
    *   **And** the Sync Card on the dashboard shows a "1 Conflict Detected" status.
    *   **When** I tap on the card.
    *   **Then** I am taken to a Conflict Resolution screen showing the two activities side-by-side.
    *   **And** I am presented with three options: "Keep Garmin", "Keep Peloton", or "Merge".
    *   **And** if I choose "Merge," a single, enriched activity is created in the destination app, combining data from both sources (e.g., GPS track from Garmin, power data from Peloton).

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   The core of this feature is the "duplicate detection" algorithm. It should be configurable (e.g., time tolerance, required data overlap).
    *   The "merge" logic will be complex and specific to each activity type. It needs a strategy for combining fields (e.g., take the max value, sum values, prefer one source over another).

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The side-by-side comparison UI must be extremely clear, highlighting the differences between the two source activities.
    *   This is a key Pro feature and a major selling point.
    *   Refer to: `02-product-scope.md`, S2.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: conflict_detected`
    *   `event: conflict_resolution_started`
    *   `event: conflict_resolution_completed`, `property: resolution` (e.g., 'merge', 'keep_source_a')

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   The merging logic could be flawed, leading to incorrect data. Mitigation: Extensive testing with real-world data is required. Allow the user to "undo" a merge for a short period.

#### **US-16:** See a single dashboard with the status of all connections.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Sarah), I want a single dashboard that shows me the status of all my connections and when they last synced so I can feel confident that everything is working correctly.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Must-Have (M-5)
*   **Story Pts:** 5

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   This story is a high-level "Epic-like" story whose requirements are fulfilled by the implementation of other, more granular stories. Its acceptance is demonstrated by the successful implementation of:
        *   **US-07 (View Sync Status):** Each card shows its individual status.
        *   **US-08 (Delete Sync):** The dashboard correctly reflects the removal of a sync.
        *   **US-04 (Configure Sync):** The dashboard correctly reflects the addition of a new sync.
        *   The main screen of the app is this dashboard.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   This story is primarily a UI/container story. It will be built using a `RecyclerView` on Android or `UICollectionView` / `List` on iOS.
    *   It will be backed by a reactive data stream from the local database that provides the list of `SyncCard` view models.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The dashboard is the main home screen of the app. It must be clean, readable, and provide at-a-glance information.
    *   Refer to: `09-ux-configuration.md`, Section 3.1.
    *   Required Diagram: `09-ux-configuration.md` - "[Mockup] High-Fidelity Main Dashboard".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: dashboard_viewed`, `property: sync_count`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-25:** "The configuration UI is too complex." - Mitigation: The dashboard itself is simple. The complexity is in the configuration screens it leads to, which is mitigated by the step-by-step flow.

---

#### **US-17:** Be shown the value of Pro features contextually.
*   **User Story:** As a free user (Sarah), I want to be clearly shown the value of upgrading to 'Pro' when I encounter a pro feature (like Conflict Resolution) so I understand what I'm paying for.
*   **Persona:** Sarah
*   **Priority:** Should-Have (S-3)
*   **Story Pts:** 3

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am a free user.
    *   **When** I attempt to use a Pro-only feature (e.g., tap on a "Conflict Detected" card, or try to access "Historical Sync").
    *   **Then** I am shown a non-blocking bottom sheet or a full-screen paywall.
    *   **And** the sheet clearly explains the feature I am trying to access and lists the other benefits of upgrading to Pro.
    *   **And** the sheet has a prominent "Unlock Pro" button that initiates the purchase flow (US-09).
    *   **And** there is a clear "Dismiss" or "Not Now" button.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   Create a reusable "Feature Gate" component that takes a feature name as input and shows the appropriate upsell content.
    *   The list of Pro features should be remotely configurable to allow for future changes.

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The upsell must be contextual and value-driven, not feel like a nag. It should answer the user's question ("What is this?") and then offer a solution.
    *   Refer to: `08-ux-onboarding.md`, Section 4, "Contextual Feature Prompts".

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: feature_gate_shown`, `property: feature_name` (e.g., 'conflict_resolution')
    *   `event: feature_gate_accepted` (user proceeds to purchase)
    *   `event: feature_gate_dismissed`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   **R-24:** Poorly communicated value. Mitigation: A/B testing different messaging for the upsell prompts is key to maximizing conversion.

#### **US-18:** Purchase a Family Plan for multiple users.
*   **User Story:** As a user (Alex), I want to purchase a single 'Family Plan' that my partner and I can use so we can both manage our health data without buying two separate licenses.
*   **Persona:** Alex
*   **Priority:** Could-Have (C-2)
*   **Story Pts:** 8

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   **Given** I am a user on the paywall screen.
    *   **When** I select the "Family Plan" option.
    *   **Then** the native purchase flow for a subscription is initiated.
    *   **And** upon successful purchase, my account is converted to a Family Plan owner.
    *   **And** I am presented with a screen where I can generate an invitation link or code.
    *   **When** my partner installs the app and enters the code.
    *   **Then** their app is also upgraded to Pro features.

*   **Technical Notes:**
    *   This requires a backend system to manage family plan memberships and invitation codes. This is a significant increase in complexity over the simple lifetime license.
    *   It will likely require a user account system (e.g., Sign in with Apple/Google) to associate users with a family plan.
    *   This would be a subscription product, not a one-time purchase, requiring handling of subscription lifecycle events (renewals, cancellations).

*   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    *   The UI for managing family members (inviting, removing) needs to be simple and intuitive.
    *   Refer to: `02-product-scope.md`, C2.

*   **Analytics Hooks:**
    *   `event: family_plan_purchase_initiated`
    *   `event: family_plan_invite_sent`
    *   `event: family_plan_invite_accepted`

*   **Associated Risks:**
    *   The introduction of user accounts and a backend significantly increases the security and privacy surface area of the app. This is a major architectural decision and is out of scope for the MVP.
