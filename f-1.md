# Technical Architecture Review: `06-technical-architecture.md`

## 1. Summary of Findings

This document presents an ambitious and modern technical architecture for the SyncWell application. It demonstrates a strong grasp of cloud-native principles, serverless technologies, and a forward-looking approach to features like AI-powered insights. The author has clearly invested significant effort in considering scalability, security, and developer experience.

However, the document, in its current state, is more of a strategic vision than a detailed, implementable blueprint. Its primary weakness is a pervasive **"everything but the kitchen sink"** approach, particularly in the open-source recommendations section, which undermines its focus and practicality. The architecture aims for a target of 1M DAU with an active-active multi-region setup from day one, which introduces immense complexity and cost that may not be justified for an early-stage product.

**Critical Findings Requiring Immediate Attention:**

1.  **Unjustified Complexity and Cost:** The proposal for an active-active, multi-region architecture for a product that has not yet launched is a significant over-engineering risk. This dramatically increases infrastructure costs, operational burden, and development complexity for a level of availability that is not yet required.
2.  **Overwhelming and Unfocused Open-Source Strategy:** Section 8, "Recommendations for Open-Source Adoption," lists over 25 tools. This is not a strategy; it's a catalog. It creates significant ambiguity about what the actual, focused technology stack is and suggests a lack of prioritization. It reads more like a list of every popular CNCF and open-source project rather than a curated set of recommendations tailored to the problem domain.
3.  **Vague AI Service Scoping:** The "AI Insights Service" is a major feature, but its requirements, data privacy implications (especially with LLMs), and operational costs are poorly defined. The use of "LangGraph" for a "stateful agent" is a complex undertaking that needs far more justification and design detail.
4.  **Incomplete Risk Analysis:** While some risks are mentioned, the document lacks a structured and comprehensive risk analysis. Critical areas like cost overruns, third-party API dependency failures, data privacy breaches in the AI service, and the sheer operational complexity of the proposed stack are not adequately addressed.

The document is a strong **Level 3 (on a 1-5 maturity scale)**. It's a good foundation for discussion but requires significant refinement, simplification, and prioritization to become a practical guide for engineering execution.

## 2. Logical Flaws, Bugs, and Inconsistencies

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LFI-01** | The Level 1 diagram shows `B[Backend]` orchestrating syncs with `A[Mobile App]`, but also shows `A[Mobile App]` initiating syncs to `B[Backend]`. This is circular and unclear. | **Medium** | Clarify the trigger. Does the backend command the app to sync, or does the app ask the backend to sync? The arrow `B -- Orchestrates syncs --> A` is particularly ambiguous. Does it mean it sends a push notification to trigger a sync? |
| **LFI-02** | The Level 2 diagram shows `WorkerLambda` polling SQS, but `RequestLambda` puts jobs on the queue. The arrow `SQSQueue -- Sends failed messages --> S3` implies a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ), but this is not explicitly stated as the *only* use of S3. | **Low** | Be more explicit. Rename S3 to `DLQ Bucket (S3)`. Clarify if S3 is used for anything else in this context. |
| **LFI-03** | The document states the backend "does not **persist** any raw user health data," but the AI Insights Service needs to process this data. The distinction between "persisting" and "processing" is critical but glossed over. | **High** | The statement is misleading. Rephrase to be precise: "The backend does not permanently store raw user health data at rest on its primary databases." Acknowledge that data is held in memory, in queues, and potentially in logs or temporary storage during processing. |
| **LFI-04** | The description for DynamoDB Global Tables mentions "multi-master replication," which is accurate. However, this model can introduce data conflicts if not handled carefully in the application logic. The document does not mention any strategy for resolving write conflicts between regions. | **High** | Acknowledge the risk of write conflicts in a multi-master setup. Describe the strategy for conflict resolution. Will it be "last writer wins," or is there a more sophisticated mechanism? |
| **LFI-05** | The load projection calculation for `Peak RPS` uses a simple `3x` multiplier on the average. This is a rule of thumb, not a projection. For a 1M DAU target, a more rigorous analysis based on expected user behavior patterns (e.g., morning/evening peaks) is required. | **Medium** | Justify the `3x` multiplier or replace it with a more detailed model of user activity throughout the day. For example, model a 12-hour active window with a 4-hour peak period. |
| **LFI-06** | The calculation for required Lambda concurrency `(90M jobs / 86400s) * 5s = ~5,200` is mathematically correct, but it assumes a perfectly even distribution of jobs throughout the day, which contradicts the "spiky" traffic pattern mentioned for choosing DynamoDB On-Demand. | **High** | Recalculate Lambda concurrency based on the *peak* job rate, not the average. Using the `3,125 RPS` peak figure, the concurrency would be closer to `3,125 jobs/s * 5s/job = 15,625`. This is a much higher (and more realistic) number and has significant implications for AWS account limits. |
| **LFI-07** | The `Status-by-User-Index` GSI uses `Status` as the partition key. The document notes this is a "low-cardinality attribute" but dismisses the concern. A low-cardinality PK for a GSI can lead to "hot partitions," severely throttling performance, especially at 1M DAU scale. | **Critical** | This is a flawed design. Do not use a low-cardinality attribute like `Status` as a GSI partition key for a high-volume table. Re-evaluate the access pattern. Could this operational task be served by exporting data to a different system (e.g., OpenSearch/Elasticsearch) for querying? Or, use a different key structure entirely. |
| **LFI-08** | In the Technology Stack table, the rationale for KMP is "Code Reuse & Performance." However, it also mentions using it on a "potential JVM backend." This is contradictory. If the backend is Lambda, the standard is to use Node.js, Python, or Go for performance (cold starts) and cost. A JVM-based Lambda has significant cold start penalties. | **High** | Clarify the backend runtime strategy. Is a JVM Lambda a serious consideration? If so, justify the performance trade-offs. If not, remove this from the KMP rationale, as it's misleading. |
| **LFI-09** | The document mentions using both LangChain and LangGraph. It states LangGraph is for the "complex, stateful graph" of the AI Troubleshooter. LangGraph is a powerful but complex library. The document provides no evidence that this level of complexity is required over a well-structured series of calls orchestrated by a simpler state machine. | **Medium** | Justify the choice of LangGraph. Provide a simplified state diagram of the "troubleshooting graph" to demonstrate why a simpler approach (e.g., AWS Step Functions, or application code) would be insufficient. |
| **LFI-10** | The `P95_ManualSyncLatency` KPI has a threshold of `> 15 seconds`. A 15-second wait for a manual sync is extremely long and would likely lead to a poor user experience. | **High** | Re-evaluate this KPI. A more reasonable target for P95 latency would be under 5 seconds. A 15-second sync should be considered a failure or a background task, not a successful synchronous operation. |
| **LFI-11** | The Level 3 component diagram for the AI Insights Service is inconsistent with its description. The diagram shows three separate components (B, C, D), but the description implies they are all part of one service. It's unclear if these are three separate endpoints, three separate microservices, or just logical functions within a single Lambda. | **Medium** | Redraw the diagram or rewrite the description to be consistent. If they are separate microservices, the architecture needs to show how they are deployed and communicate. If they are functions in one service, the diagram should reflect that. |
| **LFI-12** | The document states `SQS Queues` will use a "cross-region event-forwarding pattern" using SNS, but then immediately says a "simpler active-passive model...may be used initially." This is a major architectural decision presented as a minor note. Active-active messaging is vastly more complex than active-passive. | **Critical** | This decision must be made upfront. Define the chosen strategy and its implications for reliability and cost. Do not leave such a critical piece of the HA strategy as an ambiguous footnote. The default should be the simpler model until the need for the complex one is proven. |
| **LFI-13** | The document suggests using both Prometheus/Grafana and CloudWatch. While possible, running two separate monitoring systems adds significant operational overhead. | **Medium** | Choose one primary system for monitoring and observability to ensure focus. Justify why a second system would be needed. A common pattern is CloudWatch for infrastructure metrics and a system like Grafana/Prometheus for application-level metrics, but this needs to be explicitly stated. |
| **LFI-14** | In the table of open-source recommendations, `Redis` is listed for "Caching," with the rationale of avoiding vendor lock-in from ElastiCache. However, ElastiCache *is* Redis (or Memcached). The application code uses a Redis client, so it's already portable. This recommendation is redundant and shows a misunderstanding of the underlying service. | **High** | Remove this entry. The use of ElastiCache for Redis does not create vendor lock-in at the application code level. The rationale is flawed. |
| **LFI-15** | The document recommends both `Snyk` and `Trivy`. While they have overlapping features, the architecture should specify a primary tool for a given purpose to avoid ambiguity and redundant effort. | **Low** | Define the primary role for each tool. For example, "Snyk for application dependency scanning in the IDE and CI, and Trivy for container image scanning in the registry." |
| **LFI-16** | The document recommends both `Flyway` and `Liquibase`. These are competing tools for database schema migration. A project should standardize on one. | **Medium** | Choose one tool for database schema migration and remove the other from the recommendation list to provide clear guidance to the development team. |
| **LFI-17** | The document recommends both `k6` and `Locust` for load testing. These are competing tools. | **Medium** | Choose one primary load testing tool and remove the other. |
| **LFI-18** | The document recommends both `Metabase` and `Superset` for BI. These are competing tools. | **Medium** | Choose one BI tool. |
| **LFI-19** | The document recommends both `Jaeger` and `Zipkin` for distributed tracing. These are competing tools. | **Medium** | Choose one tracing backend. |
| **LFI-20** | The document recommends both `Airbyte` and `dbt`. These tools are complementary, not alternatives, but the description is imprecise. Airbyte is for EL (Extract, Load), and dbt is for T (Transform). | **Low** | Clarify the relationship. "Use Airbyte for data ingestion and dbt for in-warehouse data transformation." |
| **LFI-21** | The `ReAuthRate` KPI is defined, but there's no corresponding process described for how the application handles this. Does it trigger a push notification? An in-app message? An email? | **Medium** | The KPI is good, but it's not actionable without a defined process. Describe the end-to-end user experience for re-authentication. |
| **LFI-22** | The DynamoDB schema for `Sync Config` has an SK of `SYNCCONFIG#{sourceId}#to##{destId}##{dataType}`. The double hash `##` seems like a typo and could cause issues with parsing. | **Low** | Confirm the delimiter strategy. A single `#` is standard. If `##` is intentional, document why. |
| **LFI-23** | The `Historical Sync Job` item in DynamoDB tracks `TotalChunks` and `CompletedChunks`. This implies a complex orchestration mechanism (e.g., a Step Function or a "Lambda orchestrating Lambdas" pattern) that is not detailed anywhere in the architecture. | **High** | This is a critical workflow. Provide a Level 3 or Level 4 C4 diagram for the historical sync process. AWS Step Functions would be a natural fit here and should be explicitly modeled. |
| **LFI-24** | The document claims KMP allows sharing logic with a "potential JVM backend." AWS Lambda now supports SnapStart for Java, which significantly reduces cold start times. The document's dismissal of JVM on Lambda seems based on outdated information. | **Medium** | Re-evaluate the feasibility of a JVM-based Lambda in light of features like SnapStart. The trade-offs may be more favorable than implied. |
| **LFI-25** | The Level 2 diagram shows `WorkerLambda` calling the `AI_Service`. This is a Lambda-to-Lambda call, which can be problematic (e.g., cascading failures, timeout issues). A better pattern is often to have the `WorkerLambda` put a job on a queue (e.g., SQS) that the `AI_Service` polls. | **Medium** | Re-evaluate the communication pattern between the core worker and the AI service. An asynchronous, queue-based pattern would be more resilient. |

## 3. Clarity, Completeness, and Ambiguity

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CCA-01** | The term "hybrid sync model" is used to describe the mix of cloud-based and on-device syncs. However, the architecture itself is a hybrid of serverless, containers (for AI), and mobile. The term is overloaded and confusing. | **Medium** | Use more precise terminology. For example, "Multi-Modal Sync Strategy" for the sync logic, and "Hybrid Cloud-Edge Architecture" for the overall system design. |
| **CCA-02** | The document states the Level 1 diagram "remains unchanged." Unchanged from what? This implies a previous version of the document that the reviewer may not have. | **Low** | Remove the phrase "remains unchanged." Simply present the diagram as the current state of the architecture. |
| **CCA-03** | The `AI Insights Service` description is a mix of technologies (SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda) and features (conflict resolution, troubleshooter, summaries). It's unclear if this is one monolithic service or a collection of independent microservices. | **High** | Decompose the "AI Insights Service" into its constituent parts. Provide a clear architecture diagram for the AI services, showing whether they are separate, independently deployable units. |
| **CCA-04** | The document mentions "Platform Notification Services" and `F` in the Level 1 diagram but never specifies which ones (e.g., APNS, FCM). | **Low** | Be specific. List Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) as the concrete examples. |
| **CCA-05** | The description for the Mobile Application says it "manages the start of the auth flow." This is ambiguous. Does it use an embedded webview? Does it hand off to the system browser? This is a critical security and UX decision. | **High** | Specify the exact mechanism for handling OAuth/authentication flows on the mobile app (e.g., "The app will use `ASWebAuthenticationSession` on iOS and Chrome Custom Tabs on Android to follow security best practices for OAuth flows.") |
| **CCA-06** | What is a "`DataProvider`"? The document defines it as an interface but provides no examples of its methods or properties. What does the contract of this interface look like? | **High** | Provide a code snippet (e.g., in Kotlin) defining the `DataProvider` interface. This is the core of the sync engine's extensibility and must be clearly defined. |
| **CCA-07** | The document mentions "smart conflict resolution" and "intelligent conflict resolution suggestions" powered by AI. How does this work? What data does the model see? How is the "suggestion" presented to the user? This is a core feature that is completely undefined. | **Critical** | Provide a detailed user flow and data model for AI-powered conflict resolution. What does the UI look like? What data is sent to the model? How are privacy concerns (sending PHI to an AI model) addressed? |
| **CCA-08** | The "LLM-based interactive troubleshooter" is mentioned, but its scope is undefined. Is this a chatbot? Does it have access to user data? How is conversational state managed? | **High** | This feature is too vague. Provide a detailed description of the troubleshooter's capabilities, its data access policies, and the user experience. |
| **CCA-09** | The document does not include any API contract definitions. What does the request from the mobile app to the API Gateway look like? What are the key endpoints? | **Critical** | The document is incomplete without at least a high-level definition of the core API endpoints and their request/response payloads. This is a fundamental part of the architecture. |
| **CCA-10** | The document lacks a clear data model for the information being synced. What does a "steps" record look like? Or a "workout"? Without a canonical data model, it's impossible to design a conflict resolution engine. | **Critical** | Define the canonical data models for the key health data types the application will sync (e.g., `Activity`, `Sleep`, `Nutrition`). |
| **CCA-11** | The term "ephemerally in memory" is used repeatedly but is not defined. What is the maximum lifetime of this data in memory or in-flight? Minutes? Hours? This has significant security and privacy implications. | **High** | Define the maximum lifetime for in-flight data. For example, "Data is processed in memory and is guaranteed to be purged within 5 minutes of job completion or failure." |
| **CCA-12** | Section 8, "Recommendations for Open-Source Adoption," is presented without context. Is this a list of tools to be adopted immediately? A list of future possibilities? A grab-bag of ideas? The lack of framing makes the entire section confusing and unactionable. | **Critical** | Reframe Section 8 completely. Either remove it, or drastically shrink it to 3-5 key, high-priority tools with strong justification. Rename it "Potential Future Enhancements" or "Strategic Technology Choices." |
| **CCA-13** | The document does not define its non-functional requirements (NFRs) in a structured way. Latency, availability, and recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO) are scattered throughout the text but should be centralized. | **High** | Add a dedicated section for Non-Functional Requirements, specifying targets for key metrics like API response time (P95, P99), `SyncSuccessRate` (e.g., 99.95%), RTO, and RPO. |
| **CCA-14** | How are secrets managed for the mobile application itself? The document mentions Keychain/Keystore, but what about API keys or other configuration secrets that need to be bundled with the app? | **Medium** | Describe the strategy for managing build-time secrets for the mobile app. Will they be checked into a secure file in git (e.g., using git-crypt)? Injected by the CI/CD pipeline? |
| **CCA-15** | The role of the `Distributed Cache` is described, but its sizing and eviction policies are not mentioned. How much data will be cached? What is the TTL? What is the eviction policy (e.g., LRU)? | **Medium** | Provide estimates for cache size, TTLs for different data types, and the chosen eviction policy. This is critical for both performance and cost. |
| **CCA-16** | The document mentions "chunked historical data sync" but provides no details. What is the chunk size? How is progress tracked and resumed? | **High** | This is a complex process that needs to be defined. Detail the chunking strategy, the mechanism for tracking state, and the retry/resume logic. |
| **CCA-17** | What versioning strategy will be used for the APIs? How will breaking changes be handled with mobile clients? | **Critical** | Define the API versioning strategy (e.g., URL path versioning like `/v1/...`) and the policy for deprecating old client versions. |
| **CCA-18** | The document mentions SQLDelight as the on-device database but doesn't include the schema. What are the key tables that will be stored on the device? | **Medium** | Provide a high-level schema for the on-device database. |
| **CCA-19** | The term "connection" is used in the DynamoDB schema. Does this refer to the authenticated link to a third-party service? The terminology could be clearer. | **Low** | Define the key terms used in the data model. For example, add a glossary or define "Connection" as "A user's authenticated link to a third-party platform." |
| **CCA-20** | The document is missing a deployment diagram. How are these components packaged and deployed? Lambdas are deployed as ZIPs or container images. SageMaker models are deployed to endpoints. This should be visualized. | **High** | Add a C4 Level 4 diagram or a separate deployment diagram showing the deployable artifacts and how they map to the infrastructure. |
| **CCA-21** | The document mentions "Certificate Pinning." While this can enhance security, it also introduces significant operational risk (e.g., bricking apps if a certificate is rotated improperly). This decision needs more justification. | **High** | Justify the need for certificate pinning. Acknowledge the operational risks and describe the mitigation plan for certificate rotation. For many applications, standard trust chain validation is sufficient. |
| **CCA-22** | The document mentions obfuscating production builds. What level of obfuscation? What are the performance trade-offs? | **Low** | Be more specific about the obfuscation strategy (e.g., "We will use R8 on Android and consider commercial obfuscators for iOS if deemed necessary.") |
| **CCA-23** | The compliance section mentions GDPR and CCPA but provides no detail on how the architecture supports specific rights like the "right to be forgotten" or "data portability." | **High** | For each mentioned regulation, describe how the architecture specifically addresses its key requirements. How would a user's data be deleted from the entire system, including logs and backups? |
| **CCA-24** | The document does not mention a strategy for feature flagging. For a mobile app at this scale, the ability to decouple deployment from release is critical for managing risk. | **High** | Add a section on feature flagging. The recommendation for "Unleash" is buried in the giant list in Section 8, but this should be a core architectural principle. |
| **CCA-25** | The document lacks any discussion of the developer environment. How will engineers run and test this complex, serverless architecture locally? | **High** | The recommendation for "LocalStack" is buried in Section 8. This should be a core part of the architecture, not an optional add-on. Describe the local development and testing workflow. |

## 4. Technical Feasibility Assessment

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TFA-01** | Implementing and operating a true active-active multi-region architecture is extremely complex and expensive. For a new product, this is likely a premature optimization that will drain resources better spent on feature development. The risk of misconfiguration causing an outage is higher than the risk of a single region failure. | **Critical** | Start with a single-region deployment with a well-defined disaster recovery plan (e.g., active-passive with backups replicated to a second region). Evolve to multi-region only when the user base and revenue can justify the immense cost and complexity. |
| **TFA-02** | The goal of 1M DAU is ambitious. The load projections, while a good start, are based on many assumptions. The system's ability to handle the *peak* load (e.g., 15k+ concurrent Lambdas) requires careful capacity planning and proactive limit increases with AWS support. | **High** | Develop a phased rollout plan. Implement robust load testing (using a tool like k6 or Locust) to validate these assumptions and identify bottlenecks long before reaching 1M DAU. |
| **TFA-03** | The "AI Insights Service," particularly the custom-trained conflict resolution model and the LangGraph-based troubleshooter, represents a massive R&D effort. This is a high-risk, high-cost component that could delay the entire project. | **Critical** | De-scope the AI features for the initial launch. Start with a simpler, deterministic conflict resolution strategy (e.g., "source wins," "newest wins"). The AI features can be added later as a key differentiator once the core product is stable and has market traction. |
| **TFA-04** | Using KMP to share code between a mobile app and a JVM-based Lambda backend is technically possible but introduces significant constraints. The shared code cannot have dependencies on mobile-specific libraries, and the backend team is locked into the JVM ecosystem, which has trade-offs for serverless (e.g., cold starts). | **High** | Challenge this assumption. Is the complexity of maintaining a shared KMP library for the backend worth the code reuse? A separate, purpose-built backend in a more Lambda-friendly language like TypeScript or Python might be more efficient in the long run. |
| **TFA-05** | The reliance on a single-table design in DynamoDB is a modern and effective pattern, but it can be difficult to evolve. Adding new access patterns often requires creating new GSIs or restructuring the data, which can be complex and expensive. | **Medium** | Ensure the team has deep expertise in DynamoDB single-table design. For any new feature, the data modeling exercise will be critical. Consider which access patterns might be needed in the future to avoid painting yourself into a corner. |
| **TFA-06** | The sheer number of open-source tools recommended in Section 8 is not feasible to adopt and manage for a single product team. Each tool comes with operational overhead, a learning curve, and integration costs. | **Critical** | Drastically prune the list in Section 8 to a maximum of 3-5 high-impact tools that will be adopted as part of the core architecture. The rest should be moved to an appendix of "tools to consider in the future." |
| **TFA-07** | The proposal to use Temporal for historical syncs is a good one, but it's a major architectural component. Running a Temporal cluster is a significant operational responsibility. | **High** | If Temporal is to be used, it should be a central part of the architecture, not just a recommendation. Evaluate the cost-benefit of self-hosting vs. using a managed service like Temporal Cloud. For an MVP, a simpler AWS Step Functions workflow is likely more pragmatic. |
| **TFA-08** | The recommendation to use a service mesh like Linkerd or Consul is a massive over-architecture for the system described. A service mesh is designed to solve communication problems in a complex microservices environment. The current architecture has very few services. | **High** | Remove the service mesh recommendation. It is entirely inappropriate for this stage of the product. |
| **TFA-09** | The recommendation to consider ScyllaDB or Cassandra is premature. DynamoDB On-Demand can handle extreme scale. Migrating from DynamoDB to Cassandra/Scylla is a massive undertaking that should only be considered if a specific, well-understood limitation of DynamoDB is hit. | **High** | Remove this recommendation. It adds confusion and distracts from the core task of building on the chosen stack. |
| **TFA-10** | The document proposes using Terraform for IaC. This is a good choice, but managing a complex, multi-region, serverless application with Terraform can be challenging. State management, workspace organization, and module design need to be carefully planned. | **Medium** | Propose a specific structure for the Terraform codebase. How will environments (dev, staging, prod) and regions be managed? Will you use Terragrunt or a similar wrapper to keep the code DRY? |
| **TFA-11** | The use of a custom-trained ML model for conflict resolution requires a significant MLOps pipeline (data collection, labeling, training, deployment, monitoring). This is not a trivial undertaking. | **High** | If the AI feature is pursued, this document needs a dedicated section on the MLOps architecture. How will training data be collected and managed without violating user privacy? |
| **TFA-12** | The recommendation to use Kubernetes for "auxiliary services" adds another major piece of infrastructure to manage. The goal of a serverless architecture is to *reduce* operational burden, not add to it by requiring a K8s cluster. | **High** | Challenge the need for Kubernetes at this stage. Can the auxiliary services be run in a simpler environment (e.g., ECS Fargate, or even on a single EC2 instance for non-critical tools)? Avoid adding a K8s cluster unless absolutely necessary. |

## 5. Risk and Gap Analysis

| ID | Category | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation / Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RGA-01** | Security | The "AI Insights Service" is a huge security and privacy risk. Sending potentially sensitive health data (even if "ephemeral") to third-party LLMs (OpenAI is mentioned) could violate privacy policies and user trust. The process for anonymizing this data is not defined. | **Critical** | A full Privacy and Security review of the AI service is required. What is the precise data sent to the LLM? Is it possible to get the required insights without sending PHI? Is Amazon Bedrock's data privacy policy sufficient? Using external LLMs for PHI is likely a non-starter. |
| **RGA-02** | Operational | The operational cost of a 1M DAU, active-active, multi-region serverless application with an AI/ML component is likely to be extremely high. The document's claim of "cost-effectiveness" is not backed by any estimates. | **Critical** | Create a detailed cost model for the architecture at different scales (e.g., 10k, 100k, 1M DAU). Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate the costs of Lambda, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, SageMaker, and data transfer. This must be presented to stakeholders. |
| **RGA-03** | Dependency | The entire business model relies on the continued availability and stability of third-party platform APIs (Fitbit, Strava, etc.). These APIs can change, introduce bugs, have outages, or change their terms of service. This risk is not addressed. | **High** | Create a "Third-Party Dependency Risk" section. For each integrated platform, outline a plan for monitoring its health, handling breaking changes, and communicating outages to users. |
| **RGA-04** | "Unknown Unknowns" | What if the "hybrid sync" model proves too confusing for users? What if they don't understand why some syncs happen in the cloud and others require the app to be open? This architectural complexity could translate into user experience complexity. | **High** | How will the system's state and sync model be communicated to the user? Prototype and user-test the interface for managing syncs to ensure the underlying technical complexity doesn't result in a confusing product. |
| **RGA-05** | Security | The document mentions scrubbing PHI from logs, but this is notoriously difficult to get right. A single mistake could lead to a massive data leak. | **High** | What is the technical mechanism for scrubbing logs? Will it be a custom filter? A library? How will its effectiveness be tested? Consider a design where PHI is never even passed to the functions that do the logging. |
| **RGA-06** | Operational | The plan for disaster recovery is vague. "Automatic failover" with Route 53 is not a complete DR plan. What about the data in ElastiCache? What about in-flight SQS messages? | **High** | Create a dedicated, detailed Disaster Recovery Plan. It should specify the RTO and RPO, the exact failover procedure (and how it's tested), and the process for failing back to the primary region. |
| **RGA-07** | "Unknown Unknowns" | The architecture focuses heavily on the "happy path" of data syncing. What about the "unhappy path"? What happens when a third-party service is down for an extended period? Do jobs keep retrying indefinitely, driving up costs? | **High** | Define the error handling and retry logic in detail. Implement circuit breakers and exponential backoff for calls to third-party services. Define a maximum retry period before a sync is marked as "permanently failed" and the user is notified. |
| **RGA-08** | Dependency | The project relies on a large number of open-source packages. The document mentions Snyk/Dependabot, but lacks a comprehensive policy for supply chain security. | **Medium** | Define a clear policy for open-source software adoption. It should include criteria for selecting packages (e.g., maintenance status, license), a process for vetting new dependencies, and a plan for responding to newly discovered vulnerabilities. |
| **RGA-09** | Security | The DynamoDB GSI design to find users who need to re-authenticate (`GSI1PK = needs_reauth`) creates a list of all users with invalid tokens. If this index were ever improperly accessed, it would be a roadmap for an attacker. | **Medium** | Acknowledge the security implications of creating indexes on sensitive state. Ensure IAM policies are extremely strict for accessing this GSI. |
| **RGA-10** | Operational | The document does not mention chaos engineering. For a system designed for high availability at 1M DAU, it's critical to proactively test its resilience. | **High** | The recommendation for "Chaos Mesh" is buried in the list. This should be a core practice. Add a section on Resilience Testing, outlining a plan to regularly run chaos experiments in the staging environment to validate the HA architecture. |
| **RGA-11** | "Unknown Unknowns" | What alternative architectures were considered? The document presents this serverless architecture as the only option. Were other patterns (e.g., a container-based approach with ECS Fargate, a more traditional VM-based setup) evaluated and rejected? | **High** | An architecture document is stronger when it shows that alternatives were considered. Add a section briefly discussing other architectural patterns and the rationale for choosing the serverless approach. |
| **RGA-12** | Security | The document does not mention rate limiting or throttling for the API Gateway beyond what the cache provides for third-party calls. The API itself needs to be protected from abuse. | **High** | Define the rate-limiting strategy for the public-facing API Gateway. This should include per-user and per-IP limits to prevent denial-of-service or abuse. |
| **RGA-13** | Operational | How will the infrastructure be updated? How are breaking changes to Terraform modules managed? How are Lambda function versions promoted? The release management section is too high-level. | **High** | Create a detailed release management and infrastructure promotion strategy. How do changes move from dev to staging to production? Is it automated? Is there a rollback plan? |
| **RGA-14** | "Unknown Unknowns" | The business model is not mentioned, but the "SubscriptionLevel" attribute in the DynamoDB schema implies a freemium or tiered model. How does the architecture support this? Are there different usage quotas or features for different tiers? | **Medium** | The architecture should reflect the business model. If there are subscription tiers, the system needs to enforce their respective limits and feature entitlements. This is currently a gap. |
| **RGA-15** | Security | The document mentions using `SecureStorageWrapper` for Keychain/Keystore. This is good, but it doesn't address the risk of secrets being exposed on rooted/jailbroken devices. | **Medium** | Add a section on anti-tampering and device integrity checks. For a high-security application, the app should detect if it's running on a compromised device and respond accordingly (e.g., by refusing to run or limiting functionality). |
| **RGA-16** | Operational | There is no mention of a formal incident management process. "Notifying the on-call team via PagerDuty" is just one step. Who is the incident commander? How are incidents communicated internally and externally? | **High** | Add a section on Incident Management. Reference a standard framework (e.g., the Incident Command System) and define roles and communication plans for handling production outages. |
| **RGA-17** | Dependency | The architecture relies heavily on KMP. While promising, KMP is still a relatively new technology, and finding experienced developers can be challenging. The risk of hitting difficult-to-solve bugs in the KMP framework itself is higher than with more mature technologies. | **Medium** | Acknowledge the maturity risk of KMP. What is the contingency plan if a critical, unfixable bug is found in the KMP compiler or libraries? Is the team prepared to write platform-specific code as a workaround? |
| **RGA-18** | Security | The document does not address API security for the AI Insights Service. How is this service authenticated and authorized? Can any internal service call it? | **Medium** | Define the authentication and authorization model for the internal AI service API. It should use IAM roles to ensure only specific, authorized services (like the `WorkerLambda`) can invoke it. |
| **RGA-19** | Operational | The cost of cross-region data transfer in an active-active architecture can be astronomical and is often overlooked. Every write to DynamoDB Global Tables and every cross-region event incurs a cost. | **Critical** | Add "Cross-Region Data Transfer" as a specific, major line item in the cost model. This could easily become one of the largest parts of the AWS bill if not carefully managed. |
| **RGA-20** | "Unknown Unknowns" | What is the exit strategy? If, for any reason, the project needs to migrate off AWS or off the serverless model, how difficult would that be? The deep integration with DynamoDB, Lambda, and SQS creates significant vendor lock-in. | **Low** | While not an immediate concern, a mature architecture document should acknowledge the level of vendor lock-in and briefly discuss the trade-offs made. The use of open standards like KMP and SQLDelight is good, but the backend is heavily AWS-native. |
