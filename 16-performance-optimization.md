# PRD Section 16: Performance, Scalability & Reliability

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the performance, scalability, and reliability requirements for the SyncWell application. For a utility app that frequently runs in the background, these are primary features. A slow, bloated, or battery-draining app will be quickly uninstalled. This document establishes a proactive strategy for managing these factors, including strict budgets, a detailed profiling methodology, and specific optimization techniques. The requirements listed here are derived directly from the **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** specified in `04-user-stories.md`.

The goal is to ensure SyncWell is fast, fluid, and efficient on a wide range of devices. For the **solo developer**, this disciplined approach is essential for building a high-quality product and maintaining it effectively as the codebase grows.

## 2. Performance & Reliability Budget

The following budget defines the non-negotiable limits for the application. Any pull request that causes a metric to exceed this budget must be rejected or reworked.

| Metric | Target (P90) | Related User Story | Tool for Measurement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cold App Start Time** | < 2.0 seconds | General | Firebase Performance Monitoring |
| **Warm App Start Time** | < 0.7 seconds | General | Firebase Performance Monitoring |
| **Dashboard Load Time** | < 1.0 second | US-16 | Firebase Performance Monitoring (Custom Trace) |
| **Onboarding Carousel Load Time** | < 200 ms | US-01 | Firebase Performance Monitoring (Custom Trace) |
| **Sync Config Flow Transition** | < 250 ms | US-04 | Manual Timing / Flipper |
| **Manual Sync UI Feedback** | < 200 ms | US-06 | Manual Timing / Flipper |
| **Manual Sync Latency** | < 10 seconds | US-06 | Firebase Performance Monitoring (Custom Trace) |
| **Slow Frames Rate** | < 1% | General | Firebase Performance Monitoring |
| **Memory Usage (Heap)** | < 150 MB | General | Android Studio Profiler / Xcode Instruments |
| **CPU Usage (Background Sync)** | < 5% of a single core | US-05 | Android Studio Profiler / Xcode Instruments |
| **Energy Impact / Battery Drain (24h)** | < 5% | US-05 | Xcode Instruments / Android Battery Historian |
| **App Bundle Size Increase** | < 5% per PR | CI/CD script (e.g., using `danger.js`) |

### Reliability Requirements

Beyond speed, the app must be fundamentally reliable.
*   **Resilience:** The background sync (US-05) and historical sync (US-10) processes **must** be resilient to network failures. They should pause and resume automatically when connectivity is restored.
*   **API Interaction:** The app **must** gracefully handle third-party API rate limits and errors, using exponential backoff for retries and clearly communicating unrecoverable errors to the user.
*   **Idempotency:** All data-writing operations **must** be idempotent to prevent data duplication on sync retries (US-05).

## 3. Profiling & Monitoring Strategy

Performance will be actively profiled and monitored throughout the development lifecycle.

*   **Continuous Monitoring (Production):**
    *   **Tool:** Firebase Performance Monitoring & Crashlytics.
    *   **Process:** Key metrics (App Start, Screen Render Times, Crash-Free Rate) and all custom traces from the budget above will be tracked for all users in production. The developer will review these dashboards weekly to identify regressions or negative trends. Alerts will be configured for major spikes.
*   **Development-Time Profiling:**
    *   **Tool:** React Native Flipper.
    *   **Process:** Flipper will be used during daily development to inspect component render times, debug state management issues, and analyze network requests.
*   **Pre-Release Deep Dive Profiling:**
    *   **Tools:** Android Studio Profiler and Xcode Instruments.
    *   **Process:** Before every major release, a "deep dive" profiling session will be conducted on a physical, mid-range device. The focus will be on:
        *   **Memory Allocation:** Hunting for memory leaks.
        *   **CPU Usage:** Analyzing the performance of complex functions.
        *   **Energy Impact:** Ensuring background tasks are efficient and not causing excessive battery drain, validating the budget target.

## 4. Key Optimization Techniques

### Application & Bundle Size

*   **Code Splitting:** The app will use the Metro bundler's support for dynamic imports to split out non-critical features (e.g., the Historical Sync screen) into separate bundles that are loaded on demand.
*   **Asset Optimization:** All image and graphical assets will be compressed (e.g., using TinyPNG) and served in modern, efficient formats like WebP.
*   **Dependency Audits:** The developer will periodically audit the app's dependencies and remove any that are unused or could be replaced with a smaller alternative.

### UI & Rendering Performance

*   **Memoization:** React components will be wrapped in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks will be used to memoize expensive calculations and functions.
*   **List Virtualization:** All long lists of data (e.g., the sync history) will be rendered using `FlashList` (a performant alternative to `FlatList`) to ensure only visible items are rendered.
*   **Offloading to Background Threads:** Any complex data processing (e.g., parsing a large API response) will be moved off the main JavaScript thread using libraries like `react-native-threads` or by writing native modules.

## 5. Scalability

*   **Technical Scalability:**
    *   The backend is built on Firebase's serverless platform, which scales automatically with user load.
    *   The mobile app's provider-based architecture allows for the addition of new integrations without requiring a core architectural refactor.
*   **Operational Scalability (for the Solo Developer):**
    *   The key to operational scalability is automation. The CI/CD pipeline, automated testing, and automated performance/crash monitoring are what allow a single developer to manage a production application with a large user base. Time invested in improving this automation is an investment in scalability.
