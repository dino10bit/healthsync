# PRD Section 16: Performance, Scalability & Reliability

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the performance, scalability, and reliability requirements for the entire SyncWell system, from the mobile client to the AWS backend. For a utility app designed to support **1 million daily active users**, these are primary features. This document establishes a proactive strategy for managing these factors, including strict performance budgets and a detailed profiling methodology for both the client and server.

## 2. Performance & Reliability Budget

### 2.1. Client-Side Performance Budget

| Metric | Target (P90) | Tool for Measurement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cold App Start Time** | < 2.0 seconds | Firebase Performance |
| **Dashboard Load Time** | < 1.0 second | Firebase Performance |
| **Slow Frames Rate** | < 1% | Firebase Performance |
| **Memory Usage (Heap)** | < 150 MB | Android Studio / Xcode |
| **Energy Impact (24h)** | < 5% | Xcode / Battery Historian|

### 2.2. Backend Performance Budget (SLOs)

| Metric | Target | Tool for Measurement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Gateway Latency (P95)** | < 500 ms | AWS CloudWatch |
| **API Gateway Error Rate (5xx)**| < 0.1% | AWS CloudWatch |
| **Lambda Duration (P90, Hot Path)**| < 15 seconds | AWS CloudWatch |
| **Lambda Error Rate** | < 0.5% | AWS CloudWatch |
| **SQS Message Age (P99, Hot Path)**| < 10 minutes | AWS CloudWatch |

## 3. Profiling & Monitoring Strategy

### 3.1. Client-Side Profiling
*   **Continuous Monitoring (Production):** Use Firebase Performance & Crashlytics to track core metrics and regressions.
*   **Pre-Release Deep Dive:** Use Android Studio Profiler and Xcode Instruments to hunt for memory leaks and analyze energy impact.

### 3.2. Backend Profiling
*   **Continuous Monitoring (Production):** Use **AWS CloudWatch** to monitor all SLOs defined in the backend budget. Dashboards will provide real-time visibility into the health of our serverless infrastructure.
*   **Pre-Release Deep Dive:** Use **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing. X-Ray allows us to trace a single request from API Gateway through Lambda to DynamoDB, creating a service map and identifying performance bottlenecks anywhere in the backend stack.

## 4. Key Optimization Techniques

### 4.1. Client-Side Optimizations
*   **UI & Rendering:** Use list virtualization (`FlashList`), component memoization, and offloading complex processing from the main thread.
*   **Bundle Size:** Use code splitting and asset optimization to keep the app lean.

### 4.2. Backend Optimizations
*   **Lambda Performance:**
    *   **Right-Sizing:** Allocate the optimal amount of memory to each function to balance cost and performance.
    *   **Provisioned Concurrency:** For latency-sensitive functions like the initial request handler, use provisioned concurrency to eliminate cold starts.
    *   **Efficient Code:** Optimize database queries and minimize external network calls within the Lambda execution.
*   **Database Performance:**
    *   **Smart Key Design:** Use appropriate partition and sort keys in DynamoDB to ensure efficient queries.
    *   **Caching:** For read-heavy workloads, use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) as a fully managed, in-memory cache.

## 5. Scalability

The SyncWell architecture is designed from the ground up for massive, automatic scalability to meet the 1M DAU requirement.

*   **Horizontally Scalable Services:** The core of our backend—API Gateway, SQS, and Lambda—are all managed, serverless services that scale horizontally automatically. As the number of incoming requests increases, AWS automatically provisions more capacity to handle the load.
*   **Decoupled Architecture:** The use of SQS queues decouples the incoming request flow from the actual processing. This allows the system to absorb huge spikes in traffic without failing. If 100,000 users all trigger a sync at the same time, the requests are safely queued, and the worker fleet will scale up to process them.
*   **Elastic Database:** DynamoDB is an elastic NoSQL database that scales to handle virtually any amount of read/write throughput by provisioning capacity as needed.

## 6. Visual Diagrams
