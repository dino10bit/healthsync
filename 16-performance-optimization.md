# PRD Section 16: Performance & Scalability

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the performance and scalability requirements for the SyncWell application. For a utility app that frequently runs in the background, performance is a primary feature. A slow, bloated, or battery-draining app will be quickly uninstalled. This document establishes a proactive strategy for performance management, including strict performance budgets, a detailed profiling methodology, and specific optimization techniques.

The goal is to ensure SyncWell is fast, fluid, and efficient on a wide range of devices. For the **solo developer**, this disciplined approach is essential for building a high-quality product and maintaining it effectively as the codebase grows.

## 2. The Performance Budget

The following performance budget defines the non-negotiable limits for the application. Any pull request that causes a metric to exceed this budget must be rejected or reworked.

| Metric | Target (P90) | Tool for Measurement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cold App Start Time** | < 2.0 seconds | Firebase Performance Monitoring |
| **Warm App Start Time** | < 0.7 seconds | Firebase Performance Monitoring |
| **UI Render Time (Screen Transition)** | < 250 ms | Firebase Performance Monitoring |
| **Slow Frames Rate** | < 1% | Firebase Performance Monitoring |
| **Memory Usage (Heap)** | < 150 MB | Android Studio Profiler / Xcode Instruments |
| **CPU Usage (Background Sync)** | < 5% of a single core | Android Studio Profiler / Xcode Instruments |
| **Energy Impact (iOS)** | Low | Xcode Instruments |
| **App Bundle Size Increase** | < 5% per PR | CI/CD script (e.g., using `danger.js`) |

## 3. Profiling & Monitoring Strategy

Performance will be actively profiled and monitored throughout the development lifecycle.

*   **Continuous Monitoring (Production):**
    *   **Tool:** Firebase Performance Monitoring & Crashlytics.
    *   **Process:** Key metrics (App Start, Screen Render Times, Crash-Free Rate) will be tracked for all users in production. The developer will review these dashboards weekly to identify regressions or negative trends. Alerts will be configured for major spikes.
*   **Development-Time Profiling:**
    *   **Tool:** React Native Flipper.
    *   **Process:** Flipper will be used during daily development to inspect component render times, debug state management issues, and analyze network requests.
*   **Pre-Release Deep Dive Profiling:**
    *   **Tools:** Android Studio Profiler and Xcode Instruments.
    *   **Process:** Before every major release, a "deep dive" profiling session will be conducted on a physical, mid-range device. The focus will be on:
        *   **Memory Allocation:** Hunting for memory leaks.
        *   **CPU Usage:** Analyzing the performance of complex functions.
        *   **Energy Impact:** Ensuring background tasks are efficient and not causing excessive battery drain.

## 4. Key Optimization Techniques

### Application & Bundle Size

*   **Code Splitting:** The app will use the Metro bundler's support for dynamic imports to split out non-critical features (e.g., the Historical Sync screen) into separate bundles that are loaded on demand.
*   **Asset Optimization:** All image and graphical assets will be compressed (e.g., using TinyPNG) and served in modern, efficient formats like WebP.
*   **Dependency Audits:** The developer will periodically audit the app's dependencies and remove any that are unused or could be replaced with a smaller alternative.

### UI & Rendering Performance

*   **Memoization:** React components will be wrapped in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks will be used to memoize expensive calculations and functions.
*   **List Virtualization:** All long lists of data (e.g., the sync history) will be rendered using `FlashList` (a performant alternative to `FlatList`) to ensure only visible items are rendered.
*   **Offloading to Background Threads:** Any complex data processing (e.g., parsing a large API response) will be moved off the main JavaScript thread using libraries like `react-native-threads` or by writing native modules.

## 5. Scalability

*   **Technical Scalability:**
    *   The backend is built on Firebase's serverless platform, which scales automatically with user load.
    *   The mobile app's provider-based architecture allows for the addition of new integrations without requiring a core architectural refactor.
*   **Operational Scalability (for the Solo Developer):**
    *   The key to operational scalability is automation. The CI/CD pipeline, automated testing, and automated performance/crash monitoring are what allow a single developer to manage a production application with a large user base. Time invested in improving this automation is an investment in scalability.
