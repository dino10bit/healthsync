# PRD Section 16: Performance, Scalability & Reliability

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the performance, scalability, and reliability requirements for the entire SyncWell system, designed to support **1 million Daily Active Users (DAU)**. These are not secondary concerns; they are primary features critical to user trust and retention. This document establishes a proactive strategy for engineering a system that is fast, resilient, and capable of handling massive scale. It details specific architectural choices, performance targets, and optimization techniques that will be implemented.

## 3. Architecture for Performance at Scale (1M DAU)

The architecture, as defined in `06-technical-architecture.md`, is explicitly designed to be highly performant and scalable.

### 3.1. Caching Strategy with Amazon ElastiCache

A distributed, in-memory cache using **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis** is a cornerstone of our performance strategy. It serves multiple critical functions to reduce latency and database load.

*   **Configuration Caching:** User-specific sync configurations and settings are cached, dramatically reducing read operations on DynamoDB for every sync job. This lowers latency and cost.
*   **Distributed Locking:** ElastiCache provides a mechanism for distributed locks, preventing race conditions where multiple workers might attempt to process the same sync job for the same user simultaneously. This ensures data integrity without relying on slower database locks.
*   **Rate Limit Enforcement:** The cache acts as a high-speed, centralized counter for our global rate-limiting engine, enabling us to manage third-party API call frequency across thousands of concurrent Lambda functions.

### 3.2. Load Projections & Resource Planning

To ensure the system can handle the load from 1M DAU, we have projected the required capacity, as detailed in `06-technical-architecture.md`.

*   **Total Daily Jobs:** ~90 million jobs per day (real-time and historical).
*   **Peak Throughput:** ~3,125 requests per second (RPS) at peak.
*   **Required Lambda Concurrency:** ~5,200 concurrent executions.

**Actions:**
1.  The default AWS account limit for Lambda concurrency (1,000) **must be increased** to support the projected load.
2.  DynamoDB will be configured in **On-Demand Capacity Mode** to automatically scale read/write units, which is more cost-effective for our spiky workload.
3.  API Gateway and SQS scale automatically and require no specific pre-provisioning for this load.

### 3.3. Resilient Historical Syncs with Job Chunking

Syncing years of historical data (User Story **US-10**) is a performance and reliability challenge. A single, long-running process is brittle. As defined in `05-data-sync.md`, we will implement a **job chunking and orchestration strategy**.

1.  **Chunking:** A request for a multi-year sync is broken down into smaller, discrete jobs (e.g., one-month chunks).
2.  **Independent Execution:** Each chunk is processed independently by a worker from the `cold-queue`. The failure of one chunk does not affect others.
3.  **Performance Benefit:** This approach allows for massive parallelization of historical syncs, significantly reducing the total time to completion for the user. It also isolates failures and prevents a single problematic data point from halting the entire sync.

## 4. Key Optimization Techniques

### 4.1. Client-Side Optimizations
*(Unchanged)*

### 4.2. Backend Optimizations

*   **Lambda Performance:**
    *   **Right-Sizing:** Allocate the optimal amount of memory to each function to balance cost and performance.
    *   **Provisioned Concurrency:** For latency-sensitive functions like the initial request handler, use provisioned concurrency to eliminate cold starts.
    *   **Efficient Code:** The `DataProvider` SDK abstracts away boilerplate, allowing developers to focus on optimized, provider-specific logic.
*   **Database Performance:**
    *   **Smart Key Design:** Use appropriate partition and sort keys in DynamoDB to ensure efficient queries.
    *   **Caching:** Utilize **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis** as the primary caching layer, as described above. This is preferred over DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) because it provides more flexibility for our varied caching needs (e.g., counters for rate limiting, distributed locks).

## 5. Scalability

The SyncWell architecture is designed from the ground up for massive, automatic scalability.

*   **Horizontally Scalable Services:** The core of our backend—API Gateway, SQS, and Lambda—are all managed, serverless services that scale horizontally automatically. As the number of incoming requests increases, AWS automatically provisions more capacity to handle the load.
*   **Decoupled Architecture:** The use of SQS queues decouples the incoming request flow from the actual processing. This allows the system to absorb huge spikes in traffic without failing. If 100,000 users all trigger a sync at the same time, the requests are safely queued, and the worker fleet will scale up to process them.
*   **Elastic Database:** DynamoDB is an elastic NoSQL database that scales to handle virtually any amount of read/write throughput. Using **On-Demand Capacity Mode** aligns costs directly with usage and removes the need for manual capacity planning.

## 6. Visual Diagrams
