# PRD Review & Strategic Assessment: SyncWell

## 1. Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment:** The reviewed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for SyncWell represent a **mature, robust, and exceptionally detailed** foundation for product development. The level of thought given to technical architecture, security, scalability, and developer experience is characteristic of a high-functioning engineering organization. The documents demonstrate a strong commitment to modern, cloud-native best practices and a clear-eyed view of the complexities involved in building a reliable data synchronization service.

**Key Themes:**
*   **Architectural Soundness:** The serverless, event-driven architecture built on AWS is well-defined, scalable, and aligns with industry best practices for a high-availability system.
*   **Security & Privacy by Design:** Security is not an afterthought. The documents specify numerous controls, from encryption and least-privilege IAM to a dedicated Anonymizer Proxy, indicating a proactive and responsible approach to handling sensitive user data.
*   **Risk Awareness:** The PRDs do not shy away from identifying significant risks, most notably the **critical project-threatening risk** of the projected 45,000 concurrent Lambda executions and the dependency on an unofficial Garmin API. This transparency is commendable.
*   **Developer Experience Focus:** The inclusion of detailed plans for CI/CD, local development with LocalStack, and structured logging shows a mature understanding that developer velocity is a key competitive advantage.

**Primary Areas for Improvement:** While the foundation is strong, the review has identified over 100 points of ambiguity, inconsistency, and unaddressed risk that require immediate attention. These fall into several key categories:
1.  **Specification Ambiguity:** Numerous technical and functional requirements lack the precise, measurable detail required for unambiguous implementation and testing.
2.  **Incomplete Strategies:** Several critical strategies (e.g., PII data handling, error recovery, user support) are mentioned but not fully defined, leaving significant gaps for interpretation.
3.  **Misaligned Priorities:** There are instances where stated priorities (e.g., security) are undermined by specific technical decisions or lack of detail (e.g., incomplete PII scrubbing rules).
4.  **Unquantified NFRs:** Many non-functional requirements lack specific, measurable targets, making them impossible to test and validate.

**Recommendation:** The project should proceed, but implementation must be **gated** by the formal resolution of the critical issues and clarification questions raised in this review. The highest priority is to address the **45,000 Lambda concurrency risk** through the mandatory PoC and cost modeling exercises outlined in the architecture PRD.

## 2. Strengths

*   **[S-01] Comprehensive Technical Vision (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The use of the C4 model, detailed Mermaid diagrams, and a forward-looking Technology Radar provides exceptional clarity. The document is a model for how to specify a complex system.
*   **[S-02] Robust Data Sync Model (`05-data-sync.md`):** The clear distinction between the "Hot Path" and "Cold Path" and the detailed, stateful synchronization algorithm provide a solid foundation for the core feature.
*   **[S-03] Proactive Security & Privacy (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The architecture demonstrates a deep commitment to security, with detailed plans for encryption, least privilege, egress filtering, and data anonymization.
*   **[S-04] Scalability by Design (`16-performance-optimization.md`):** The architecture is explicitly designed for scale, leveraging serverless components, resilient queuing, and a multi-faceted caching strategy.
*   **[S-05] Outcome-Oriented Roadmap (`13-roadmap.md`):** The roadmap is wisely framed around strategic themes and business outcomes rather than a rigid list of features, allowing for agility and data-informed prioritization.
*   **[S-06] Standardized Integration (`07-apis-integration.md`):** The `DataProvider` SDK concept is a best practice for ensuring maintainable and scalable third-party integrations.

## 3. Gaps & Issues

This section details specific points of ambiguity, incompleteness, or inconsistency.

### 3.1 Clarity & Completeness

#### `05-data-sync.md`
*   **[C-001] Undefined Conflict Threshold:** Sec 4.1 states a conflict is detected if time ranges overlap by "more than a configured threshold (defaulting to **60 seconds**)". It is unclear where this threshold is configured (e.g., AppConfig) and if it is global or per-user/per-provider.
*   **[C-002] Ambiguous `PushResult` Handling:** Sec 3, Step 7 states that on a partial failure, the "entire job will be considered failed." It is unclear what happens to the successfully pushed items from that failed job during the SQS retry. This could lead to data duplication.
*   **[C-003] Missing Diagram for AI Troubleshooter:** Sec 9 recommends LangGraph for an `Interactive AI Troubleshooter` but provides no diagram or state machine to illustrate the proposed flow, unlike other core components.

#### `06-technical-architecture.md`
*   **[C-004] Ambiguous Idempotency Key Header:** Sec 3a specifies a required `Idempotency-Key` header. It must explicitly state the exact header name (e.g., `Idempotency-Key` vs. `X-Idempotency-Key`) to avoid ambiguity.
*   **[C-005] Undefined "Canary" Metrics:** Sec 9, "Deployment Strategy" mentions monitoring key metrics during a canary release but does not define the acceptable deviation. What % increase in latency or error rate triggers an automatic rollback? This must be defined.
*   **[C-006] Incomplete PII Stripping Strategy:** Sec 6, "PII Stripping Strategy" table is explicitly noted as "not exhaustive". This is a critical security area that cannot be left incomplete. It must be updated with a comprehensive list of all fields across all canonical models.
*   **[C-007] Undefined `ReAuthStatus` Values:** Sec 3c, "Supporting Operational Access Patterns" mentions a `ReAuthStatus` attribute for a sparse GSI. The possible values for this attribute are not defined.
*   **[C-008] Unspecified `jobId` Format:** Sec 3d, `POST /v1/sync-jobs` returns a `jobId`. The format (e.g., UUID, prefixed string) is not specified.
*   **[C-009] Missing `DELETE /v1/connections/{connectionId}` Endpoint:** The API contract defines how to get connections (`GET /v1/connections`) but not how a user can delete a specific connection. This is a critical user control requirement.
*   **[C-010] Unspecified Linter for `ProviderTokens`:** Sec 3e states a "custom static analysis rule (linter) MUST be implemented" to prevent serialization of `ProviderTokens`. The specific linter technology (e.g., Detekt custom rule) is not specified.
*   **[C-011] Ambiguous "Shard" Calculation:** Sec 3f states a shard is calculated as `hash(userId) % total_shards`. The specific, deterministic hashing algorithm (e.g., Murmur3, SHA-256) is not defined. Using a non-deterministic hash would be catastrophic.
*   **[C-012] Undefined Offline Action Queue Schema:** Sec 3g defines an offline "actions" table in SQLDelight but does not specify the table's schema.
*   **[C-013] Missing `sprint-based timeline`:** In section 4 of `13-roadmap.md` there is a reference to a sprint plan that is not present in `04-user-stories.md`.

#### `07-apis-integration.md`
*   **[C-014] Undefined `priority` Field Values:** Sec 4a states the event payload for a sync job "must include a `priority` field". The possible values (e.g., `"high"`, `"low"`) are mentioned but not formally defined as a required enum.
*   **[C-015] Incomplete `PushResult` Specification:** Sec 2.2 defines `PushResult` with `failedItemIds`. It is unclear if the `DataProvider` implementation is responsible for populating this or if the SDK handles it. The mechanism for identifying the failed items is not specified.
*   **[C-016] Ambiguous Circuit Breaker Configuration:** Sec 8 states circuit breaker thresholds are configurable per-provider but does not specify the full set of configurable parameters (e.g., reset timeout, success threshold for closing).
*   **[C-017] Undefined `DateRange` Model:** The `fetchData` method in the `DataProvider` interface uses a `DateRange` model whose schema is not defined in the document.

#### `13-roadmap.md`
*   **[C-018] Undefined "Top Voted Integration" Process:** The Q2 and Q3 roadmaps include adding the "Top Voted Integration". The document does not specify the tool or process for collecting, ranking, and selecting these integrations.
*   **[C-019] Ambiguous "Hardening" Sprint Scope:** The Q4 roadmap includes a "hardening" sprint. The specific activities, goals, and definition of done for this sprint are not defined.
*   **[C-020] Missing OKR Tree:** Sec 6 mentions a placeholder for an "OKR Tree" diagram. This is a valuable artifact that should be completed to link strategy to execution.

#### `16-performance-optimization.md`
*   **[C-021] Unspecified "Hot Table" Trigger:** Sec 4.2 mentions a "hot table" approach for mitigating hot partitions. The specific metrics and thresholds that would trigger a user's migration to this hot table are not defined.
*   **[C-022] Missing Job Chunking Flow Diagram:** Sec 6 notes that the diagram for the historical sync job chunking flow is missing and "To be created". This is a critical part of the historical sync design.
*   **[C-023] Missing Cost Model:** Sec 3.2 makes the creation of a detailed cost model a mandatory prerequisite, but no such model is provided or referenced.

### 3.2 Structure & Prioritization

*   **[S-001] Inconsistent Document Structure:** The documents are generally well-structured, but there are minor inconsistencies. For example, some have a "Visual Diagrams" section, while others embed diagrams directly. A standardized template would improve readability.
*   **[S-002] Lack of Centralized Glossary:** `06-technical-architecture.md` references a root `GLOSSARY.md` file. While excellent in principle, this file was not provided for review. Centralized terminology is critical.
*   **[S-003] Buried Critical Risks:** The "potential project-threatening risk" of 45,000 concurrent Lambdas is mentioned in `06-technical-architecture.md` but detailed more thoroughly in `16-performance-optimization.md`. Such a critical risk should be highlighted consistently and prominently in all relevant documents, including the Executive Summary of the main architecture PRD.

### 3.3 Strategic & Business Alignment

*   **[B-001] Unstable MVP Integration (`07-apis-integration.md`):** The inclusion of the "unofficial, reverse-engineered" Garmin API in the MVP (Sec 5) directly contradicts the Q1 roadmap theme of "Build the Most Reliable Sync Engine on the Market" (`13-roadmap.md`, Sec 3). An unstable integration introduces significant reliability risk.
*   **[B-002] Missing ROI for "Hardening" Sprint (`13-roadmap.md`):** The Q4 "hardening" sprint is strategically wise, but the business value is not articulated. It should be framed in terms of reducing future operational costs, improving developer velocity, or mitigating specific scaling risks.
*   **[B-003] Missing Monetization Details for Family Plan (`13-roadmap.md`):** The Q4 roadmap includes a "Family Health Plan". The document lacks any detail on the proposed pricing, feature set, or target market for this new tier, making it difficult to assess its strategic value.

### 3.4 Technical Feasibility & Constraints

*   **[T-001] KMP/JVM Cold Start on Authorizer (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** Sec 3, "Components" makes a non-negotiable statement that the `AuthorizerLambda` **must** be in a faster runtime like TypeScript/Python. However, Sec 4, "Technology Stack" states the cross-platform framework is KMP. This creates a contradiction. If KMP is the standard, the team may not have the skills or desire to maintain a separate runtime for a single function. This trade-off needs to be explicitly accepted by the engineering team.
*   **[T-002] Lack of Fallback for Secrets Manager (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The architecture relies heavily on AWS Secrets Manager. Sec 3, "Components" notes that the `SecureStorageWrapper` must throw a `SecureStorageUnavailableException`, but no system-level fallback strategy is defined. What happens if Secrets Manager is unavailable for an extended period? Does the entire sync system halt?
*   **[T-003] Unspecified Throttled Scan Implementation (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** Sec 3c, "Supporting Operational Access Patterns" mentions a "throttled `Scan`" as a fallback. The mechanism for throttling (e.g., using a specific library, a custom wait-loop) is not defined.
*   **[T-004] Overly Optimistic AppConfig Caching (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** Sec 2, "Centralized Configuration Management" states the risk of AppConfig failure is mitigated by "aggressive client-side caching within the Lambda functions". This caching behavior is not guaranteed by the AWS SDK and can vary. Relying on it as a primary mitigation for a high-impact failure is risky.

### 3.5 User Experience & Accessibility

*   **[U-001] No Defined User Support Flow for DLQ (`05-data-sync.md`):** Sec 5 states that failed jobs move to a DLQ for "manual inspection". There is no defined process for how this inspection translates into user communication or resolution. How is the user notified of the permanent failure? What is the SLA for resolving these issues?
*   **[U-002] Missing User Notification for Rate Limiting (`07-apis-integration.md`):** Sec 4a defines a robust rate-limiting system where jobs are returned to the queue with a delay. However, there is no mention of notifying the user that their sync is delayed due to provider rate limits. This can lead to perceived unreliability.
*   **[U-003] No Defined Flow for `needs_reauth` (`07-apis-integration.md`):** Sec 4.2 states that a `PermanentAuthError` marks the connection as `needs_reauth` and triggers a push notification. It does not specify what the user sees in the app or how the UI guides them to resolve the issue.
*   **[U-004] No Graceful Degradation for AppConfig Failure (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** While the risk of an AppConfig outage is mentioned, there is no discussion of how the application should behave. Should it fail completely, or operate in a degraded mode with default configurations?

### 3.6 Risk Assessment

*   **[R-001] Underestimated Blast Radius of AppConfig (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** Sec 2, "Centralized Configuration Management" identifies the risk of AppConfig failure but may underestimate it. Storing the primary DynamoDB table name in AppConfig means an outage could take down the entire application, yet this is not categorized as a "High" strategic risk.
*   **[R-002] Missing Mitigation for JWT Key Cache (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** Sec 3b, "Caching Strategy" specifies caching JWT public keys for 1 hour. This creates a risk where a compromised key could be considered valid for up to an hour after revocation. This risk is not identified or mitigated.
*   **[R-003] Unaddressed Risk of `ChangeMessageVisibility` Failure (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The rate-limiting backoff mechanism (Sec 3b) relies on the SQS `ChangeMessageVisibility` API. This API call can fail. The document does not specify the retry/failure handling for this critical part of the backoff strategy.
*   **[R-004] Missing Risk of Time Drift (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The `ProviderTokens` data class (Sec 3e) includes an `issuedAtEpochSeconds` field. This implies that time-based calculations will be performed. The risk of clock skew/drift between distributed components is not identified or addressed. Using a centralized, reliable time source is critical.

## 4. Risks & Dependencies

This section highlights the most critical risks and dependencies that could impact the project's success.

*   **[RISK-CRITICAL-01] 45,000 Lambda Concurrency (`06-technical-architecture.md`, `16-performance-optimization.md`):** This is correctly identified as a potential project-threatening risk. The project's viability is entirely dependent on the outcome of the mandatory cost modeling and PoC load tests. **This is the single most significant risk to the project.**
*   **[RISK-HIGH-02] Unofficial Garmin API (`07-apis-integration.md`):** Building a core MVP feature on an unstable, reverse-engineered API introduces extreme reliability and business risk. The provider could change or block the API at any moment, destroying user trust.
*   **[RISK-HIGH-03] Firebase Authentication Dependency (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The hard dependency on a non-AWS service for the critical path of user authentication is a significant strategic risk. An outage in Firebase Auth renders the entire application unusable. The proposed mitigation of "drafting an exit strategy" is insufficient; a concrete plan is needed.
*   **[RISK-MED-04] Incomplete PII Anonymization Strategy (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The security of the platform is dependent on a PII stripping strategy that is explicitly defined as "not exhaustive". This is a significant compliance and privacy risk that must be fully mitigated before any user data is processed.
*   **[RISK-MED-05] Complexity of Hybrid Runtime (`06-technical-architecture.md`):** The decision to require the `AuthorizerLambda` to be written in a non-KMP language introduces complexity in the toolchain, CI/CD pipeline, and team skill set. This risk should be formally acknowledged and accepted.

## 5. Recommendations

*   **[REC-CRITICAL-01] Gate Implementation on Concurrency PoC:** Do not proceed with full-scale implementation until the mandatory PoC and cost modeling for the 45,000 Lambda concurrency scenario are complete and approved by all stakeholders.
*   **[REC-HIGH-02] Remove Garmin from MVP:** Defer the Garmin integration until it can be supported via an official, stable API. Replace it in the MVP with another provider that has a robust, public API to align with the core reliability goal.
*   **[REC-HIGH-03] Define All "To-Do" Items:** Treat all items marked as "not exhaustive", "to be created", or "not defined" as blocking issues. The PRDs must be updated to be complete and specific before they can be considered final. This includes the PII stripping rules, all missing diagrams, and API schemas.
*   **[REC-MED-04] Develop a Formal User Support Playbook:** Create a dedicated document defining the end-to-end process for handling user-facing errors, including those that result in a DLQ'd message. This playbook should define SLAs, communication templates, and escalation paths.
*   **[REC-LOW-05] Standardize PRD Structure:** Adopt a single, standardized template for all PRDs to improve consistency and readability. Create and maintain the central `GLOSSARY.md` file.

## 6. Clarification Questions
