# PRD Section 14: QA, Testing & Release Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA), testing, and release strategy for SyncWell. In a data-centric application where trust and reliability are paramount, a rigorous approach to quality is not optional. The objective is to implement a systematic process that proactively finds and eliminates defects, ensuring a stable, performant, and trustworthy application. This plan is designed to directly verify the Acceptance Criteria and Non-Functional Requirements laid out in `04-user-stories.md`.

For a **solo developer**, this strategy is a force multiplier. By emphasizing automation and clear processes, it enables the delivery of a high-quality product efficiently and sustainably.

## 2. QA Philosophy

*   **Automation as a Default:** We will automate everything that can be reasonably automated. Manual testing is reserved for exploratory testing and validating the overall user experience, not for repetitive regression checks.
*   **Quality is Built-In, Not Bolted-On:** Quality is the developer's responsibility at every stage. Tests are written concurrently with features, not as an afterthought.
*   **Shift-Left Mentality:** We aim to catch bugs as early in the development lifecycle as possible. A bug caught by a unit test is orders of magnitude cheaper to fix than one found by a user in production.

## 3. The SyncWell Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the principles of the classic testing pyramid.

*   **Level 1: Unit Tests (70% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test individual functions, classes, and algorithms in isolation.
    *   **Scope:** Data transformation logic, sync logic, conflict resolution rules, permission primer logic.
    *   **Tools:** `kotlin.test`, `XCTest`.
*   **Level 2: Integration / Component Tests (20% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between related components.
    *   **Scope:** UI components rendering correctly for given states, ViewModels updating state correctly, API providers working against mock servers.
    *   **Tools:** `ComposeTestRule`, `XCTest`, Turbine, MockWebServer.
*   **Level 3: End-to-End (E2E) Tests (10% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test a full "happy path" user journey through the application's UI.
    *   **Scope:** The critical user flows: onboarding, configuring a sync, upgrading to Pro, restoring a purchase.
    *   **Tools:** **Maestro**. It is chosen for its simplicity, fast setup, and reliability. Its declarative YAML-based syntax makes tests easy to write and maintain, which is a significant advantage for a solo developer or a small team.

## 4. Specialized Test Plans

### Performance & Reliability Budget Validation
*   **Objective:** To formally verify that the application meets the specific performance and reliability targets defined in `16-performance-optimization.md`.
*   **Methodology:** During the "Pre-Release Deep Dive Profiling" phase mentioned in that document, the developer will execute a specific test run on a physical, mid-range device. This run will involve:
    *   Measuring app start, dashboard load, and other specific screen timings against the budget.
    *   Executing a background sync and measuring its battery and CPU impact.
    *   Simulating network loss during a sync to verify the resilience requirement.
*   **Outcome:** A checklist based on the Performance Budget table will be filled out. Any metric failing its target will be considered a release blocker.

### Analytics Event Testing
*   **Objective:** To ensure that all analytics events fire correctly, so that the KPIs in `41-metrics-dashboards.md` are accurate.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   As part of the development process for any new feature, the developer will use tools like Firebase DebugView to manually trigger and verify that the correct events are sent with the correct parameters.
    *   This verification will be added as a mandatory item to the Definition of Done.

### Exploratory and Negative Path Testing
*   **Objective:** To uncover bugs and issues in scenarios that are difficult to automate ("unhappy paths").
*   **Methodology:** During the manual testing phase for a release, a dedicated session will be spent on exploratory testing. This is a non-scripted, creative testing process focusing on:
    *   **Failure States:** Intentionally causing OAuth flows to fail, revoking permissions in system settings, turning off network during a sync.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Using invalid inputs, rapidly tapping buttons, testing on devices with unusual screen sizes or settings.
    *   **Usability:** Assessing the overall feel and flow of the app, looking for confusing UI or awkward workflows.

### Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (Pact)
*   **Objective:** To ensure that the mobile client (the "Consumer") and the backend API (the "Provider") can evolve independently without introducing breaking changes. This prevents a common class of bugs where a backend change unexpectedly breaks an older version of the mobile app.
*   **Tooling:** **Pact**.
*   **Methodology:** The testing process follows the standard consumer-driven contract workflow:
    1.  **Consumer-Side:** In the mobile app's test suite, integration tests are written that define the expectations of the backend API. These tests mock the API requests and define the exact responses the client expects to receive.
    2.  **Contract Generation:** When these tests run, Pact generates a "contract" file (a JSON document) that describes these expectations.
    3.  **Contract Publication:** The generated contract is published to a central "Pact Broker".
    4.  **Provider-Side Verification:** In the backend's CI/CD pipeline, a verification step is triggered. The backend fetches the contract from the Pact Broker and replays the requests against the live API. It then verifies that the actual responses match the expectations defined in the contract.
*   **CI/CD Integration:**
    *   The mobile client's CI pipeline is configured to automatically publish new versions of the contract to the Pact Broker whenever a change is made to an API integration test.
    *   The backend's CI pipeline is configured to fail if the API verification step fails. This acts as a crucial quality gate, preventing the deployment of any backend change that would break the contract with the mobile client.
*   **Success Criteria:** A backend deployment can only proceed if it successfully verifies against all relevant contracts in the Pact Broker.

### Staging & Test Data Strategy
*   **Objective:** To provide development, staging, and local environments with realistic, but fully anonymized, data for testing purposes. Under no circumstances will real production user data be used in non-production environments.
*   **Methodology:** A dedicated, scheduled process will be created to generate a sanitized data set.
    1.  **Data Source:** The process will use a curated, internal set of sample raw data that mirrors the structure of production data but contains no real user information.
    2.  **Anonymization Pipeline:** This sample data will be processed through the same `Anonymization Pipeline` defined in `19-security-privacy.md`. This ensures that our test data adheres to the same privacy standards as our analytics data.
    3.  **Data Loading:** The resulting anonymized data will be loaded into the DynamoDB tables and other data stores in the staging and local (LocalStack) environments.
*   **Process:** This data generation process will be automated and run as part of the environment setup and refresh scripts. This ensures that developers always have access to a fresh, realistic, and safe set of data for testing.

### Load Testing
*   **Objective:** To formally verify that the backend system can handle the peak load of **3,000 requests per second (RPS)** as defined in the non-functional requirements, and to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks before they impact users.
*   **Tooling:** **k6 (by Grafana Labs)** will be used for scripting and executing load tests. k6 is chosen for its developer-friendly, scriptable API (using JavaScript) and its high performance.
*   **Environment:** Load tests will be run against a dedicated, production-scale staging environment. This environment will be a mirror of the production environment, with the same infrastructure configuration, to ensure that test results are representative.
*   **Test Scenarios:** The load test suite will include a variety of scenarios to simulate realistic user behavior and stress the system in different ways:
    *   **Spike Test:** A sudden, massive increase in traffic to simulate a viral event or a coordinated sync (e.g., after a notification). The goal is to verify that the SQS queue can absorb the spike and that the system remains stable.
    *   **Soak Test:** A sustained, high-load test over a long period (e.g., 4-8 hours). The goal is to identify memory leaks, performance degradation over time, and other issues that only manifest under prolonged load.
    *   **Stress Test:** A test that pushes the system beyond its expected limits (e.g., >10,000 RPS). The goal is to understand how the system fails and to ensure that it fails gracefully (e.g., by throttling requests) rather than crashing.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** A smaller-scale load test will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to run on every merge to the `develop` branch. This will provide early feedback on performance regressions. Full-scale load tests will be run manually before each major release.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The system must handle 10,000 RPS with P95 latency below 500ms for API Gateway and a Lambda error rate below 0.5%.
    *   The SQS queue depth should not grow uncontrollably during the soak test.
    *   The system should not crash during the stress test.

### Security Testing
*   **Objective:** To proactively identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in the mobile application and backend services, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
*   **Strategy:** A multi-layered security testing strategy will be implemented, integrating security into the development lifecycle.
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
    *   **Tooling:** A SAST tool (e.g., Snyk Code, SonarQube) will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Process:** The SAST scanner will automatically analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure cryptographic storage) on every pull request.
    *   **Success Criteria:** A pull request will be blocked from merging if the SAST scan identifies any new "Critical" or "High" severity vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**
    *   **Tooling:** A DAST tool (e.g., OWASP ZAP) will be used to scan the running application in the staging environment.
    *   **Process:** DAST scans will be run on a regular schedule (e.g., weekly) against the staging environment to identify runtime vulnerabilities (e.g., security misconfigurations, insecure headers).
    *   **Success Criteria:** Any "Critical" or "High" severity findings from the DAST scan will be triaged and added to the backlog as high-priority bugs.
*   **Third-Party Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Process:** Before the initial public launch and on an annual basis thereafter, a reputable third-party security firm will be commissioned to conduct a comprehensive penetration test of the entire system (mobile app and backend).
    *   **Scope:** The penetration test will include a thorough assessment of the application's security posture, including its resistance to common attack vectors (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
    *   **Success Criteria:** All "Critical" and "High" severity findings from the penetration test must be remediated before the public launch.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [ ] There are no new, high-priority accessibility issues introduced.
*   [ ] Any necessary user-facing documentation (e.g., a new FAQ article) has been drafted.

## 6. Beta Program Management

*   **Recruitment:** Beta testers will be recruited from a waitlist collected on the pre-launch website.
*   **Distribution:** iOS via TestFlight, Android via Google Play Console's "Internal testing" track.
*   **Feedback Collection:** A dedicated private channel (e.g., Discord) will be used for feedback.
