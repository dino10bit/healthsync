# PRD Section 14: QA, Testing & Release Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA), testing, and release strategy for SyncWell. In a data-centric application where trust and reliability are paramount, a rigorous approach to quality is not optional. The objective is to implement a systematic process that proactively finds and eliminates defects, ensuring a stable, performant, and trustworthy application.

For a **solo developer**, this strategy is a force multiplier. By emphasizing automation and clear processes, it enables the delivery of a high-quality product efficiently and sustainably, forming a key part of the project's risk mitigation plan.

## 2. QA Philosophy

*   **Automation as a Default:** We will automate everything that can be reasonably automated. Manual testing is reserved for exploratory testing and validating the overall user experience, not for repetitive regression checks.
*   **Quality is Built-In, Not Bolted-On:** Quality is the developer's responsibility at every stage. Tests are written concurrently with features, not as an afterthought.
*   **Shift-Left Mentality:** We aim to catch bugs as early in the development lifecycle as possible. A bug caught by a unit test is orders of magnitude cheaper to fix than one found by a user in production.

## 3. The SyncWell Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the principles of the classic testing pyramid.

*   **Level 1: Unit Tests (70% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test individual functions and classes in complete isolation.
    *   **Scope:** Data transformation logic in `DataProvider` modules, business logic in the `SyncProcessor`, state management reducers/blocs.
    *   **Tools:** Jest (React Native) or `test` package (Flutter).
*   **Level 2: Integration / Component Tests (20% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between related components.
    *   **Scope:**
        *   **Widget/Component Tests:** Verifying that UI components render correctly based on given props/state.
        *   **Provider Integration Tests (Mocked):** Verifying that a `DataProvider` correctly interacts with a mocked API client.
        *   **State Management Integration:** Verifying that UI events correctly trigger state changes and subsequent logic.
    *   **Tools:** React Native Testing Library, Flutter's `flutter_test`.
*   **Level 3: End-to-End (E2E) Tests (10% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test a full user journey through the application's UI.
    *   **Scope:** A small, critical set of "happy path" scenarios, including:
        1.  The full onboarding flow.
        2.  Configuring a new sync.
        3.  Initiating a purchase.
    *   **Tools:** Detox (React Native) or Patrol (Flutter).

## 4. Definition of Done (DoD)

A user story or feature is not considered "done" until it meets the following criteria:
*   [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.
*   [ ] All necessary unit and integration tests are written and passing in the CI pipeline.
*   [ ] Code has been peer-reviewed (or self-reviewed against a checklist if no peer is available).
*   [ ] The feature has been manually tested on both a physical iOS and Android device.
*   [ ] There are no new, high-priority accessibility issues introduced.
*   [ ] Any necessary user-facing documentation (e.g., a new FAQ article) has been drafted.

## 5. Beta Program Management

*   **Recruitment:** Beta testers will be recruited from a waitlist collected on the pre-launch website and via social media channels. They will be users who are enthusiastic about the product and understand they are testing pre-release software.
*   **Distribution:**
    *   **iOS:** Builds will be distributed via Apple's **TestFlight**.
    *   **Android:** Builds will be distributed via the **Google Play Console's "Internal testing" or "Closed testing" tracks**.
*   **Feedback Collection:** A dedicated communication channel (e.g., a private Discord server or a specific email address) will be set up for beta testers to report bugs and provide feedback.

## 6. Pre-Release Checklist & Staged Rollout

Before any public release, the following checklist must be completed for the release candidate build:
1.  [ ] **CI Pipeline Green:** All automated tests (Unit, Integration, E2E) are passing on the `release` branch.
2.  [ ] **Manual Test Pass:** A full manual test of all major user flows is completed and passed.
3.  [ ] **Beta Feedback Reviewed:** All feedback from the beta testers for this version has been reviewed and any blocking issues have been resolved.
4.  [ ] **Release Notes Finalized:** The "What's New" text for the app stores is written and ready.
5.  **Deployment (Staged Rollout):**
    *   Release to **1%** of users on both platforms. Monitor crash rates and key metrics for 24 hours.
    *   Increase to **10%**. Monitor for 24 hours.
    *   Increase to **50%**. Monitor for 24 hours.
    *   If all metrics remain stable, release to **100%**.
    *   **Rollback Plan:** If a critical issue is discovered at any stage, the rollout will be immediately halted.

## 7. KPIs & Success Metrics

*   **Code Coverage:** >80% for core logic modules.
*   **CI Build Time:** The time it takes for the full test suite to run. Must be kept reasonably low (<15 minutes) to not slow down development.
*   **Escaped Defect Rate:** The number of bugs reported by users in production per release. The goal is to keep this number as low as possible.
*   **Crash-Free User Rate:** >99.5%.

## 8. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders

*   **[Diagram] The Testing Pyramid for SyncWell:** A diagram showing the three levels of the pyramid and listing the specific types of tests that belong in each level for this app.
*   **[Diagram] CI/CD Pipeline Flowchart:** A flowchart showing the triggers and steps in the CI/CD pipeline, from code commit to a successful build with passing tests.
*   **[Checklist] Pre-Release Manual Test Plan:** A sample checklist table with columns for Test Case, Steps, Expected Result, and Pass/Fail status.
*   **[Flowchart] Staged Rollout Decision Tree:** A diagram showing the process and decision points for the staged rollout.
