# PRD Section 14: QA, Testing & Release Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA), testing, and release strategy for SyncWell. In a data-centric application where trust and reliability are paramount, a rigorous approach to quality is not optional. The objective is to implement a systematic process that proactively finds and eliminates defects, ensuring a stable, performant, and trustworthy application. This plan is designed to directly verify the Acceptance Criteria and Non-Functional Requirements laid out in `04-user-stories.md`.

For a **solo developer**, this strategy is a force multiplier. By emphasizing automation and clear processes, it enables the delivery of a high-quality product efficiently and sustainably.

## 2. QA Philosophy

*   **Automation as a Default:** We will automate everything that can be reasonably automated. Manual testing is reserved for exploratory testing and validating the overall user experience, not for repetitive regression checks.
*   **Quality is Built-In, Not Bolted-On:** Quality is the developer's responsibility at every stage. Tests are written concurrently with features, not as an afterthought.
*   **Shift-Left Mentality:** We aim to catch bugs as early in the development lifecycle as possible. A bug caught by a unit test is orders of magnitude cheaper to fix than one found by a user in production.

## 3. The SyncWell Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the principles of the classic testing pyramid.

*   **Level 1: Unit Tests (70% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test individual functions, classes, and algorithms in isolation.
    *   **Scope:** Data transformation logic, sync logic, conflict resolution rules, permission primer logic.
    *   **Tools:** `kotlin.test`, `XCTest`.
*   **Level 2: Integration / Component Tests (20% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between related components.
    *   **Scope:** UI components rendering correctly for given states, ViewModels updating state correctly, API providers working against mock servers.
    *   **Tools:** `ComposeTestRule`, `XCTest`, Turbine, MockWebServer.
*   **Level 3: End-to-End (E2E) Tests (10% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test a full "happy path" user journey through the application's UI.
    *   **Scope:** The critical user flows: onboarding, configuring a sync, upgrading to Pro, restoring a purchase.
    *   **Tools:** Maestro, Appium, or similar cross-platform E2E framework.

## 4. Specialized Test Plans

### Performance & Reliability Budget Validation
*   **Objective:** To formally verify that the application meets the specific performance and reliability targets defined in `16-performance-optimization.md`.
*   **Methodology:** During the "Pre-Release Deep Dive Profiling" phase mentioned in that document, the developer will execute a specific test run on a physical, mid-range device. This run will involve:
    *   Measuring app start, dashboard load, and other specific screen timings against the budget.
    *   Executing a background sync and measuring its battery and CPU impact.
    *   Simulating network loss during a sync to verify the resilience requirement.
*   **Outcome:** A checklist based on the Performance Budget table will be filled out. Any metric failing its target will be considered a release blocker.

### Analytics Event Testing
*   **Objective:** To ensure that all analytics events fire correctly, so that the KPIs in `41-metrics-dashboards.md` are accurate.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   As part of the development process for any new feature, the developer will use tools like Firebase DebugView to manually trigger and verify that the correct events are sent with the correct parameters.
    *   This verification will be added as a mandatory item to the Definition of Done.

### Exploratory and Negative Path Testing
*   **Objective:** To uncover bugs and issues in scenarios that are difficult to automate ("unhappy paths").
*   **Methodology:** During the manual testing phase for a release, a dedicated session will be spent on exploratory testing. This is a non-scripted, creative testing process focusing on:
    *   **Failure States:** Intentionally causing OAuth flows to fail, revoking permissions in system settings, turning off network during a sync.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Using invalid inputs, rapidly tapping buttons, testing on devices with unusual screen sizes or settings.
    *   **Usability:** Assessing the overall feel and flow of the app, looking for confusing UI or awkward workflows.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

A user story or feature is not considered "done" until it meets the following criteria:
*   [ ] All acceptance criteria from the user story are met.
*   [ ] All necessary unit and integration tests are written and passing in the CI pipeline.
*   [ ] Code has been peer-reviewed (or self-reviewed against a checklist if no peer is available).
*   [ ] **(New)** All new analytics events are verified to fire correctly with the expected properties using development tools (e.g., Firebase DebugView).
*   [ ] The feature has been manually tested on both a physical iOS and Android device, covering both happy and unhappy paths.
*   [ ] There are no new, high-priority accessibility issues introduced.
*   [ ] Any necessary user-facing documentation (e.g., a new FAQ article) has been drafted.

## 6. Beta Program Management

*   **Recruitment:** Beta testers will be recruited from a waitlist collected on the pre-launch website.
*   **Distribution:** iOS via TestFlight, Android via Google Play Console's "Internal testing" track.
*   **Feedback Collection:** A dedicated private channel (e.g., Discord) will be used for feedback.

## 7. Pre-Release Checklist & Staged Rollout

Before any public release, the following checklist must be completed for the release candidate build:
1.  [ ] **CI Pipeline Green:** All automated tests are passing.
2.  [ ] **Manual Test Pass:** A full manual test of all major user flows is completed, including exploratory testing.
3.  [ ] **(New)** Performance Budget Validated: The checklist from the Performance Budget Validation test plan is completed and all targets are met.
4.  [ ] **Beta Feedback Reviewed:** All feedback from beta testers is reviewed and blocking issues are resolved.
5.  [ ] **Release Notes Finalized:** "What's New" text is ready.
6.  **Deployment (Staged Rollout):**
    *   Release to **1%** of users. Monitor crash rates and key metrics for 24 hours.
    *   Increase to **10%**. Monitor for 24 hours.
    *   Increase to **50%**. Monitor for 24 hours.
    *   If all metrics remain stable, release to **100%**.
    *   **Rollback Plan:** If a critical issue is discovered, the rollout will be immediately halted.

## 8. KPIs & Success Metrics

*   **Code Coverage:** >80% for critical business logic modules.
*   **Escaped Defect Rate:** <5 critical bugs reported by users in the first month after a major release.
*   **Crash-Free User Rate:** >99.9% as reported by Firebase Crashlytics.

## 9. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders

*   **[Diagram] The Testing Pyramid for SyncWell:** A diagram showing the three levels of the pyramid.
*   **[Diagram] CI/CD Pipeline Flowchart:** A flowchart showing the triggers and steps in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **[Checklist] Pre-Release Manual Test Plan:** A sample checklist table for manual testing.
*   **[Flowchart] Staged Rollout Decision Tree:** A diagram showing the process and decision points for the staged rollout.
