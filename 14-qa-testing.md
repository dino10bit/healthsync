# PRD Section 14: QA, Testing & Release Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA), testing, and release strategy for SyncWell. In a data-centric application where trust and reliability are paramount, a rigorous approach to quality is not optional. The objective is to implement a systematic process that proactively finds and eliminates defects, ensuring a stable, performant, and trustworthy application.

For a **solo developer**, this strategy is a force multiplier. By emphasizing automation and clear processes, it enables the delivery of a high-quality product efficiently and sustainably, forming a key part of the project's risk mitigation plan.

## 2. QA Philosophy

*   **Automation as a Default:** We will automate everything that can be reasonably automated. Manual testing is reserved for exploratory testing and validating the overall user experience, not for repetitive regression checks.
*   **Quality is Built-In, Not Bolted-On:** Quality is the developer's responsibility at every stage. Tests are written concurrently with features, not as an afterthought.
*   **Shift-Left Mentality:** We aim to catch bugs as early in the development lifecycle as possible. A bug caught by a unit test is orders of magnitude cheaper to fix than one found by a user in production.

## 3. The SyncWell Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the principles of the classic testing pyramid.

*   **Level 1: Unit Tests (70% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test individual functions and classes in the shared KMP module.
    *   **Scope:** Data transformation logic, `SyncManager` logic, `ConflictResolutionEngine` rules.
    *   **Tools:** `kotlin.test` framework.
*   **Level 2: Integration / Component Tests (20% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between related components.
    *   **Scope:**
        *   **UI Component Tests:** Verifying that Jetpack Compose (Android) and SwiftUI (iOS) components render correctly for given states.
        *   **Flow/State Tests:** Verifying that UI events correctly trigger state changes in ViewModels using libraries like Turbine.
        *   **API Provider Tests:** Testing the Ktor-based API providers against mock web servers.
    *   **Tools:** `ComposeTestRule`, `XCTest`, Turbine.
*   **Level 3: End-to-End (E2E) Tests (10% of tests)**
    *   **Purpose:** To test a full user journey through the application's UI, interacting with a staging version of the backend.
    *   **Scope:** The critical "happy path" scenarios (onboarding, configuring a sync, upgrading to Pro).
    *   **Tools:** Patrol, which enables writing tests in a single Dart codebase for both iOS and Android.

## 4. Specialized Test Plans

Given the complexity of the new strategic features, we will implement several specialized test plans in addition to the standard pyramid.

### Scalability & Load Testing
*   **Objective:** To verify that the AWS backend can handle the target load of 1 million DAU and 10,000 RPS.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   A load testing script will be created using a tool like **k6** or **Artillery**.
    *   The script will simulate thousands of concurrent users making sync requests to the API Gateway endpoint.
    *   We will run a "stress test" to find the breaking point of the system and a "soak test" (running a high load for an extended period) to identify memory leaks or performance degradation over time.
*   **KPIs:** P99 latency remains below 200ms under load, SQS queue depth remains manageable, no unexpected spikes in Lambda errors.

### Conflict Resolution Logic Testing
*   **Objective:** To ensure the `Smart Conflict Resolution Engine` is logically flawless and handles all edge cases.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   A dedicated suite of hundreds of unit tests will be created for the engine.
    *   This suite will feed the engine pairs of "source" and "destination" activity data representing every conceivable scenario: exact duplicates, partial overlaps, activities with different data streams (e.g., one has GPS, the other has Heart Rate), etc.
    *   The output of the `Merge Intelligently` strategy will be asserted against a known-good, expected output for each scenario.

### Cross-Platform E2E Testing
*   **Objective:** To provide end-to-end verification of the flagship "Apple Health <> Google Fit" bridge feature.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Using an E2E framework like Patrol, we will write a test that orchestrates actions on both an iOS Simulator and an Android Emulator.
    *   **Step 1:** The test creates a new health data point (e.g., a 1000-step walk) directly in Apple Health on the iOS Simulator.
    *   **Step 2:** The test opens SyncWell on the iOS device and triggers a manual sync.
    *   **Step 3:** The test then switches to the Android Emulator, opens Google Fit, and asserts that the 1000-step walk now appears correctly.
    *   This test will be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch any regressions in the most critical user flow.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

A user story or feature is not considered "done" until it meets the following criteria:
*   [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.
*   [ ] All necessary unit and integration tests are written and passing in the CI pipeline.
*   [ ] Code has been peer-reviewed (or self-reviewed against a checklist if no peer is available).
*   [ ] The feature has been manually tested on both a physical iOS and Android device.
*   [ ] There are no new, high-priority accessibility issues introduced.
*   [ ] Any necessary user-facing documentation (e.g., a new FAQ article) has been drafted.

## 5. Beta Program Management

*   **Recruitment:** Beta testers will be recruited from a waitlist collected on the pre-launch website and via social media channels. They will be users who are enthusiastic about the product and understand they are testing pre-release software.
*   **Distribution:**
    *   **iOS:** Builds will be distributed via Apple's **TestFlight**.
    *   **Android:** Builds will be distributed via the **Google Play Console's "Internal testing" or "Closed testing" tracks**.
*   **Feedback Collection:** A dedicated communication channel (e.g., a private Discord server or a specific email address) will be set up for beta testers to report bugs and provide feedback.

## 7. Pre-Release Checklist & Staged Rollout

Before any public release, the following checklist must be completed for the release candidate build:
1.  [ ] **CI Pipeline Green:** All automated tests (Unit, Integration, E2E) are passing on the `release` branch.
2.  [ ] **Manual Test Pass:** A full manual test of all major user flows is completed and passed.
3.  [ ] **Beta Feedback Reviewed:** All feedback from the beta testers for this version has been reviewed and any blocking issues have been resolved.
4.  [ ] **Release Notes Finalized:** The "What's New" text for the app stores is written and ready.
5.  **Deployment (Staged Rollout):**
    *   Release to **1%** of users on both platforms. Monitor crash rates and key metrics for 24 hours.
    *   Increase to **10%**. Monitor for 24 hours.
    *   Increase to **50%**. Monitor for 24 hours.
    *   If all metrics remain stable, release to **100%**.
    *   **Rollback Plan:** If a critical issue is discovered at any stage, the rollout will be immediately halted.

## 8. KPIs & Success Metrics

*   **Code Coverage:** >90% for the `ConflictResolutionEngine` and other critical business logic modules.
*   **Load Test SLOs:** All performance targets (P99 latency, etc.) must be met during the automated load tests.
*   **Escaped Defect Rate:** <5 critical bugs reported by users in the first month after a major release.
*   **Crash-Free User Rate:** >99.9%.
