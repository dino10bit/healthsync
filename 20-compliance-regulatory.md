# PRD Section 20: Legal & Regulatory Compliance

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines SyncWell's comprehensive strategy for ensuring and maintaining compliance with all relevant legal, regulatory, and platform-specific policies. Adherence to these rules is a non-negotiable, foundational requirement for the app's launch and continued operation. This document serves as a centralized, actionable guide to navigating this complex landscape.

For the **solo developer**, this structured approach de-risks the project by making compliance a manageable, checklist-driven process. For **investors**, it provides assurance that the business is built on a sound legal footing, mitigating the risk of costly legal challenges or removal from app stores.

## 2. Compliance as a Feature

We do not view compliance as a burden, but as a core feature of our product. In a market where users are increasingly concerned about their data, our demonstrable commitment to legal and ethical data handling is a key competitive differentiator. Our compliance strategy is designed to build user trust and reinforce our brand promise of being the most private and secure way to manage health data.

## 3. The Compliance Scorecard

This scorecard is a living document that will be reviewed quarterly to ensure ongoing compliance.

| Regulation / Policy | Key Requirement | Implementation Status | Last Reviewed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GDPR** | Clear Privacy Policy | Implemented | - |
| **GDPR** | User consent for analytics | Implemented (Opt-out) | - |
| **GDPR** | Right to data deletion | Implemented (De-authorize feature) | - |
| **CCPA** | "Do Not Sell" Info | Addressed in Privacy Policy | - |
| **Apple App Store** | Guideline 5.1 (Privacy) | Implemented | - |
| **Apple App Store** | Guideline 3.1 (Payments) | Implemented | - |
| **Google Play Store**| User Data Policy | Implemented | - |
| **Google Play Store**| Health Data Permissions | Implemented | - |

## 4. Third-Party API Compliance

Adherence to the terms of service for each integrated API is critical to prevent access revocation.

| API Platform | Data Use Restrictions (Limited Use) | Branding Requirements | Key Rate Limits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Fit / Health Connect** | Data cannot be used for advertising or sold. Must only be used for user-facing health features. | Use of official logos must follow guidelines. | 10,000 requests per user per day. |
| **Fitbit** | Similar "Limited Use" policy. Stricter rules on data aggregation and display. | Requires "Sync with Fitbit" button with official branding. | 150 requests per user per hour. |
| **Garmin Connect** | Data can only be displayed to the user it belongs to. Cannot be aggregated across users. | Requires use of official Garmin logos and naming. | Varies by endpoint; generally less restrictive but must be monitored. |
| **Strava** | Data cannot be re-syndicated. Must honor user privacy settings (e.g., private activities). | Requires "Connect with Strava" button. | 600 requests every 15 minutes; 30,000 daily. |

## 5. Implementation of Compliance Measures

### 5.1. User Consent Flow

Consent will be obtained at multiple, specific points in the user journey:
1.  **Onboarding:** Before completing the welcome carousel, the user must check a box: "I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service."
2.  **Permission Priming:** For each OS-level permission (Notifications, HealthKit, etc.), a pre-permission dialog will explain why access is needed before the OS prompt is shown.
3.  **Analytics Consent:** For users in the EU, analytics tracking will be disabled by default. It will only be enabled if the user explicitly opts-in via the toggle in the Privacy & Security settings.
4.  **Third-Party OAuth:** The consent screen presented by each third-party service (e.g., Fitbit's login page) serves as the user's explicit consent to share data from that platform with SyncWell.

### 5.2. Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)

As a data controller under GDPR, we must have DPAs in place with our data processors.
*   **Firebase:** Google's standard DPA will be reviewed and accepted.
*   **RevenueCat:** RevenueCat's standard DPA will be reviewed and accepted.
*   **Help Desk Software:** The chosen help desk provider must offer a GDPR-compliant DPA.

## 6. Execution Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Legal Document Drafting (2 weeks)**
    *   Draft the initial versions of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
    *   Engage a legal professional specializing in mobile apps and GDPR/CCPA for review.
2.  **Phase 2: Compliance-Aware Development (Ongoing)**
    *   Implement the consent flows and permission priming dialogs.
    *   Review all third-party API developer agreements and implement any required branding or UI elements.
3.  **Phase 3: Pre-Launch Compliance Audit (1 week)**
    *   Go through the Compliance Scorecard and the API Compliance table line-by-line.
    *   Verify that all consent flows are working as expected.
    *   Finalize and publish the legal documents.

## 7. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Table] Compliance Scorecard:** A detailed, multi-row version of the scorecard in Section 3.
*   **[Flowchart] User Consent Journey:** A flowchart showing every point in the app where user consent is requested and how the app behaves based on the user's choice.
*   **[Diagram] Data Processor Map:** A diagram showing SyncWell as the "Data Controller" and services like Firebase and RevenueCat as "Data Processors," with arrows indicating the flow of non-health data.
