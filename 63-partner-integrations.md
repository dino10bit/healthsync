# PRD Section 63: Partner Integration Strategy (Deep Dive)

## 1. Introduction
SyncWell's core value proposition is the breadth and reliability of its third-party service integrations. This document provides a granular breakdown of the strategy, processes, and technical architecture for expanding our ecosystem of integrations.

## 2. Strategic Framework

### 2.1. Integration Categories
To ensure a balanced offering, we classify integrations into categories:
-   **Wearables:** (e.g., Garmin, Fitbit, Oura, WHOOP) - Core to our user base.
-   **Nutrition Apps:** (e.g., MyFitnessPal, Cronometer) - A key expansion area.
-   **Workout Platforms:** (e.g., Strava, Peloton, TrainingPeaks) - High user demand.
-   **Wellness Platforms:** (e.g., Corporate wellness portals, meditation apps) - Strategic growth area.

### 2.2. Prioritization Framework
New integrations will be prioritized based on a scoring system that considers the following factors:

| Factor | Description | Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Demand** | How many users have requested this integration via feedback channels? | 40% |
| **Market Size** | What is the size of the potential partner's user base? | 20% |
| **Strategic Value** | Does this integration open up a new, important user segment? | 20% |
| **Technical Feasibility**| How complex is the partner's API? Do they have good documentation? | 15% |
| **Marketing Opportunity**| Is there potential for a co-marketing partnership? | 5% |

A running list of potential integrations will be maintained and scored against this framework quarterly.

## 3. Technical Architecture & Design

### 3.1. The "DataProvider" SDK
-   **Purpose:** To standardize the process of adding new integrations, each integration must be built against our internal `DataProvider` SDK, which is based on the "plug-in" model defined in `06-technical-architecture.md`.
-   **Interface:** Any new integration must implement the `DataProvider` interface, which creates a standardized contract for all integrations.

```kotlin
// Simplified for documentation purposes.
interface DataProvider {
    /**
     * A unique, machine-readable key for the provider (e.g., "strava", "fitbit").
     */
    val providerKey: String

    /**
     * Handles the initial OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to acquire tokens.
     */
    suspend fun authenticate(authCode: String): ProviderTokens

    /**
     * Refreshes an expired access token using a refresh token.
     */
    suspend fun refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: String): ProviderTokens

    /**
     * Fetches data from the provider's API and transforms it into a canonical model.
     */
    suspend fun fetchData(tokens: ProviderTokens, dateRange: DateRange): List<CanonicalWorkout>

    /**
     * Pushes a canonical data model to the provider's API.
     */
    suspend fun pushData(tokens: ProviderTokens, data: CanonicalWorkout): PushResult
}
```
-   **Benefit:** This approach enforces a consistent architecture, reduces boilerplate code, and makes integrations easier to test and maintain.

### 3.2. Authentication Strategy per Partner
-   **OAuth 2.0:** This is the preferred method and will be used wherever possible. The secure authentication flow is detailed in `07-apis-integration.md`.
-   **API Keys / Other:** For partners without OAuth, API keys and other credentials will be encrypted at rest and stored securely.
-   **Secure Token Storage:** User-specific `access_token` and `refresh_token` are never stored directly in the database. They are encrypted and stored in **AWS Secrets Manager**. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this secret is then stored in the user's `Connection` item in the `SyncWellMetadata` DynamoDB table, as defined in the core technical architecture. This ensures that a compromise of the primary database does not expose user credentials for third-party services.

### 3.3. Data Mapping & Transformation
-   **Canonical Model:** SyncWell has an internal, canonical data model for every supported data type (e.g., a `CanonicalWorkout` object).
-   **Transformation Layer:** Each `DataProvider` is responsible for transforming data from the partner's unique format into our canonical model (when fetching) and from our model back to their format (when posting). This isolates the partner-specific logic.

## 4. Development & Release Process

### 4.1. Technical Feasibility Study - Template
Before development, the assigned engineer must complete this study:
-   [ ] **API Docs URL:**
-   [ ] **Authentication Method:**
-   [ ] **Key Data Endpoints:** (List them)
-   [ ] **Rate Limits:** (e.g., 1000 requests/hour)
-   [ ] **Data Formats:** (e.g., JSON, XML)
-   [ ] **Key Challenges/Risks:** (e.g., "API has poor documentation," "No sandbox environment available")

### 4.2. "Alpha" and "Beta" Partner Programs
1.  **Internal Alpha:** Once an integration is developed, it is used internally by the team for 1 week to identify major bugs.
2.  **User Beta:** We will invite a small group of users who specifically requested the integration to join a "beta" program. They will get early access in exchange for providing feedback. This is managed via a feature flag.
3.  **Public Release:** After a successful beta period (typically 2-4 weeks), the feature flag is removed, and the integration is made available to all users.

## 5. Maintenance & Deprecation

### 5.1. Error Handling & Retries for Partner APIs
-   **Monitoring:** All API calls to partner services are logged, and the error rates are monitored (`64-server-monitoring.md`).
-   **Retries:** For transient errors (e.g., 5xx server errors from the partner), we will implement an exponential backoff retry strategy.
-   **Circuit Breaker:** If a partner's API is down for an extended period, a circuit breaker will automatically disable the integration temporarily to prevent system-wide failures.

### 5.2. Rate Limiting Strategy
-   Our backend will use a distributed rate limiter (e.g., using Redis) to ensure that we never exceed the published rate limits for any given partner API across our entire user base.

### 5.3. Deprecation Policy
1.  **Detection:** We will monitor partner developer blogs and changelogs for deprecation announcements.
2.  **User Communication:** If an integration is being deprecated, we will notify all users who actively use it at least 60 days in advance via email and in-app messaging.
3.  **Removal:** On the deprecation date, the integration will be removed from the app.

## 6. Analysis & Calculations
### 6.1. Prioritization Score Calculation Example
-   **Hypothesis:** The weighted scoring framework allows us to make objective, data-informed decisions about which integrations to build next.
-   **Scenario:** We are comparing two potential new integrations: "HealthApp A" and "FitnessDevice B".
-   **Scoring (on a scale of 1-10 for each factor):**

| Factor | Weight | HealthApp A Score | FitnessDevice B Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| User Demand | 40% | 9 (highly requested) | 4 (moderately requested) |
| Market Size | 20% | 5 (niche but growing) | 8 (large user base) |
| Strategic Value | 20% | 7 (opens new 'wellness' segment) | 5 (overlaps with existing users) |
| Technical Feasibility | 15% | 8 (modern GraphQL API) | 3 (old SOAP API, poor docs) |
| Marketing Opportunity | 5% | 3 (no co-marketing) | 7 (keen to co-promote) |

-   **Calculation:**
    -   **HealthApp A Weighted Score** = (9*0.4) + (5*0.2) + (7*0.2) + (8*0.15) + (3*0.05) = 3.6 + 1.0 + 1.4 + 1.2 + 0.15 = **7.35**
    -   **FitnessDevice B Weighted Score** = (4*0.4) + (8*0.2) + (5*0.2) + (3*0.15) + (7*0.05) = 1.6 + 1.6 + 1.0 + 0.45 + 0.35 = **4.95**
-   **Conclusion:** Despite FitnessDevice B having a larger market size, HealthApp A is the clear winner due to high user demand, strategic value, and superior technical feasibility. We will prioritize building the integration for HealthApp A.

### 6.2. Development Cost vs. Return Analysis
-   **Hypothesis:** The value of a new integration (in terms of new subscribers) should outweigh its development and maintenance cost.
-   **Analysis:**
    -   *Cost:* A standard new integration is estimated to take **40-60 developer-hours** (or ~5-8 story points). This includes research, development, testing, and documentation.
    -   *Return:* We need to estimate how many new users will subscribe *because* of this new integration.
-   **Example Calculation (for HealthApp A):**
    -   *Assumptions:*
        -   The "HealthApp A" integration is a key deciding factor for 2,000 new trial users per year.
        -   Our standard 15% trial-to-paid conversion rate applies.
    -   *New Subscribers per Year* = 2,000 * 15% = 300.
    -   *Annual LTV of these Subscribers* = 300 * $85 (LTV from `58-marketing-and-seo.md`) = **$25,500**.
-   **Conclusion:** The annual return from the new subscribers attracted by this single integration is estimated at over $25,000, which vastly outweighs the one-time development cost. This justifies the investment.

## 7. Out of Scope
-   Building integrations for partners who do not have a public, documented API.
-   Financial partnerships or revenue sharing with partners (V1 is purely technical integration).
