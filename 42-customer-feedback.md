# PRD Section 42: Customer Feedback Collection & Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the detailed operational specification for SyncWell's customer feedback management system. The goal is to create a systematic process for actively soliciting, collecting, analyzing, and—most importantly—acting on qualitative user feedback. This system ensures that the user's voice is a primary driver of the product development lifecycle.

For the **solo developer**, this feedback loop is the most valuable source of market intelligence available. It provides direct insight into user pain points, desires, and validation of the product's direction. This document details the tools and processes for turning that raw feedback into actionable, prioritized development work.

## 2. The Feedback Loop Architecture

Our feedback system is a closed loop designed to ensure that user input is never lost and that users feel heard.

1.  **Collection:** Gather feedback from all channels (Support Tickets, App Store Reviews, Feedback Portal).
2.  **Centralization & Triage:** Funnel all feedback into a central tool (e.g., a dedicated project in a tool like Productboard, or a well-managed Trello board) for analysis.
3.  **Analysis & Synthesis:** Tag feedback by theme (e.g., `ux-friction`, `bug`, `new-integration-request`). Identify trends and recurring pain points.
4.  **Prioritization:** Link synthesized insights to feature ideas. Use the weight of feedback (e.g., number of users reporting the same issue) as a key input into the roadmap prioritization process.
5.  **Action:** Build the features or fix the bugs that were prioritized based on the feedback.
6.  **Close the Loop:** When a feature is shipped, proactively notify the users who requested it.

## 3. Feedback Collection Channels & Tools

| Channel | Tool | Purpose | Process |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Support** | **Freshdesk** | Capturing detailed bug reports and user frustrations. | A Freshdesk automation rule will tag any ticket that is not a simple "how-to" question with `feedback-triage` for weekly review. |
| **Feature Requests**| **Canny.io** | Public, democratic prioritization of new features and integrations. | The developer will monitor new suggestions and merge duplicates. The number of votes is a key input for the Integration Scorecard. |
| **App Store Reviews**| **Appfigures / App Store Connect** | Gauging broad public sentiment and identifying major issues. | All reviews below 3 stars will be copied into the central feedback tool for triage. The developer will respond to all negative reviews. |
| **In-App Surveys**| **Firebase In-App Messaging** | Proactively asking specific questions to targeted user segments (e.g., NPS surveys). | A quarterly NPS survey will be sent to a segment of long-term, active users. |

## 4. Analysis & Synthesis Process

Raw feedback is not immediately actionable. It must be processed.

*   **The "Jobs to Be Done" (JTBD) Framework:** When analyzing feedback, the developer will use the JTBD lens. Instead of just taking a feature request literally ("add a blue button"), the developer will ask *why* the user is asking for it. What is the underlying "job" they are trying to get done? This leads to better, more innovative solutions.
*   **Tagging Taxonomy:** A consistent set of tags will be used in the feedback management tool:
    *   **Source:** `source:email`, `source:app-store`, `source:canny`
    *   **Type:** `type:bug`, `type:feature-request`, `type:ux-issue`
    *   **Theme:** `theme:garmin`, `theme:ui-design`, `theme:billing`
*   **Weekly Triage Meeting (with myself):** The developer will hold a recurring 1-hour meeting every Friday to:
    1.  Review all new feedback from the `feedback-triage` tag.
    2.  Apply the full tagging taxonomy.
    3.  Identify any urgent bugs that need to be moved into the `hotfix` backlog.
    4.  Update the vote counts on existing feature ideas.

## 5. Closing the Loop: The Most Important Step

*   **Canny.io Automation:** When a feature on the Canny.io board is moved to "Complete," the system will automatically send an email to every user who voted for or commented on that feature, announcing that it is now live.
*   **Personalized Support Follow-ups:** For users who reported a specific bug or frustration via email, the developer will send a personal follow-up email after the fix has been released. (e.g., "Hi Sarah, I just wanted to let you know that the bug you reported with Fitbit sleep data has now been fixed in version 1.3.0. Thanks again for your help!"). This creates immense user loyalty.
*   **Public Changelog:** The "What's New" screen in the app will explicitly credit user feedback as a source for new features.
