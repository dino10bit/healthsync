# Required PRD Document Updates

**Update: All required updates listed in this document were completed on 2025-08-18.**

Based on the recent enhancements to the core technical documents (`05-data-sync.md`, `06-technical-architecture.md`, `07-apis-integration.md`), the following PRDs required updates to maintain consistency and reflect the new architectural decisions.

This list was generated after a comprehensive review and enhancement of the system architecture to support **1 million Daily Active Users**.

| Document to Update | Section(s) to Review | Reason for Update | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`16-performance-optimization.md`** | Entire document | The introduction of a **caching layer (ElastiCache)**, **load projections**, and a **job chunking strategy** for historical syncs are major performance optimizations that must be documented here. | **High** | **Completed** |
| **`18-backup-recovery.md`** | Entire document | The move to a **multi-region architecture** fundamentally changes the disaster recovery strategy. This document needs to be updated to describe the new multi-region failover and data restoration process using DynamoDB Global Tables and cross-region secret replication. | **High** | **Completed** |
| **`21-risks.md`** | Risk Register | New risks should be added, and existing ones updated. For example, a new risk related to "cache stampede" or "cross-region data replication lag" should be added. The mitigation for API rate limiting (`R-19`) should be updated to reference the new distributed rate limiter defined in `07-apis-integration.md`. | **Medium** | **Completed** |
| **`31-historical-data.md`** | Entire document | The new **job chunking and orchestration strategy** for historical syncs defined in `05-data-sync.md` must be fully detailed in this document, replacing any previous, less-specific plans. | **High** | **Completed** |
| **`32-platform-limitations.md`** | API Rate Limits | This document must be updated to include the specific, known rate limits for each third-party API. This is now a critical input for configuring the new rate-limiting engine. | **Medium** | **Completed** |
| **`44-contingency-planning.md`** | Entire document | The contingency plan for a regional outage is now much more robust. This document should be updated to describe the **Route 53 failover procedure** and the expected Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for the new multi-region setup. | **High** | **Completed** |
| **`24-user-support.md`**| Interactive Troubleshooter | The architecture now specifies using **LangGraph** for the interactive troubleshooter. This document should be updated to reflect that technical decision and its implications for the user experience. | **Low** | **Completed** |
| **`30-sync-mapping.md`**| DataProvider SDK | The introduction of the `DataProvider SDK` in `07-apis-integration.md` provides a new framework for data mapping. This document should be updated to reflect how mappings will be implemented within the new SDK structure. | **Medium** | **Completed** |
