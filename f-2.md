# Technical Architecture Review: SyncWell

---

## 1. Summary of Findings

### Executive Summary

The SyncWell documentation suite represents a significant body of work, with several well-considered, detailed specifications. The documents describing the core AWS-native serverless architecture (`06`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `34`, `35`) present a coherent, modern, and scalable vision. This "official" architecture is sound and demonstrates a clear understanding of cloud-best-practices for a system of this scale.

However, this review has uncovered a **critical and systemic failure of architectural alignment** across the document set. A second, competing "shadow" architecture—one based on a complex, powerful, and operationally burdensome suite of self-hosted open-source tools (Temporal, Kong, Vault, etc.)—is proposed and recommended in key application-level documents (`05`, `07`).

This architectural schizophrenia is the single most severe issue facing the project. The two proposed architectures are fundamentally incompatible, and the documentation makes no attempt to reconcile them. The cross-cutting concerns for the shadow architecture—including security, disaster recovery, monitoring, cost, and operational overhead—are almost entirely unaddressed, creating a massive blind spot that introduces unacceptable risk.

### Most Critical Findings

1.  **CRITICAL: Three Competing Designs for Historical Sync:** For the single most complex feature (historical data sync), the documentation proposes three different, mutually exclusive technical solutions: AWS Step Functions (`06`), Temporal.io (`05`), and a bespoke Lambda/SQS/DynamoDB implementation (`31`). This is a showstopper that indicates a severe breakdown in communication and architectural governance. The project cannot proceed until a single path is chosen.
2.  **CRITICAL: Unaddressed Operational Burden of Open-Source Stack:** The recommendations to adopt tools like Temporal, Vault, Kong, and Keycloak introduce a massive, unstated operational burden. These are not "plug-and-play" solutions; they are complex, stateful systems that require significant expertise to deploy, manage, secure, and maintain in a highly available manner. The feasibility of a small team managing this stack is highly questionable.
3.  **CRITICAL: Inadequate Security & DR for "Shadow" Architecture:** The security (`19`) and disaster recovery (`18`) plans are well-defined *only* for the AWS-native stack. They are completely inadequate for the proposed open-source stack. There is no plan for securing, backing up, or failing over a self-hosted Vault, Temporal cluster, or Kong gateway. This is a critical gap that leaves the project exposed to massive security and reliability risks.

**Overall Maturity:** The maturity of the documentation is dangerously polarized. The AWS-native architectural documents are mature (High). The application-level documents that propose the conflicting open-source stack are immature (Low) because they fail to consider the wider implications of their recommendations. The project is at a critical inflection point where it must aggressively enforce a single, unified architectural vision before proceeding.

## 2. Logical Flaws, Bugs, and Inconsistencies

This section details direct contradictions and logical errors found within the documentation.

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| L-001 | **Three different designs for historical sync.** `06-technical-architecture.md` specifies AWS Step Functions. `31-historical-data.md` specifies a custom Lambda+SQS orchestrator. `05-data-sync.md` recommends replacing the custom orchestrator with Temporal.io. | **Critical** | Immediately convene an architectural review board to select a *single* orchestration strategy. Update all documents to reflect this decision. |
| L-002 | **Contradictory Error/Log Aggregation Strategy.** `17-error-handling.md` specifies AWS CloudWatch as the sole backend monitoring and alerting tool. `07-apis-integration.md` recommends adopting GlitchTip/Sentry for error tracking. | **High** | Choose a single system of record for error aggregation and alerting. Document how it will be used and integrated. |
| L-003 | **Contradictory API Gateway Strategy.** `06-technical-architecture.md` specifies AWS API Gateway. `07-apis-integration.md` recommends adopting Kong. | **High** | Decide on a single API Gateway strategy. The added complexity of Kong for this simple architecture seems unjustified. |
| L-004 | **Contradictory Secrets Management Strategy.** `06-technical-architecture.md` specifies AWS Secrets Manager. `07-apis-integration.md` recommends adopting HashiCorp Vault. | **High** | Decide on a single secrets management strategy. The operational burden of self-hosting Vault is likely too high. |
| L-005 | **Contradictory Monitoring and Metrics Strategy.** `17-error-handling.md` and `39-performance-metrics.md` focus on AWS CloudWatch. `05-data-sync.md` and `07-apis-integration.md` recommend Prometheus and Grafana. | **High** | Decide on a single observability stack. An AWS-native approach with CloudWatch is simpler and more integrated. |
| L-006 | **Incorrect Load Projection Math.** In `06-technical-architecture.md`, the "Peak RPS" calculation `45M / 14400s = ~3,125 RPS` is correct, but the "Average RPS" `90M / 86400s = ~1,042 RPS` is used as a baseline. The peak is 3x the average, not a minor variation. The entire capacity plan depends on this peak number. | **Medium** | Re-evaluate all capacity and cost models based *only* on the peak RPS figure, as average RPS is irrelevant for scaling. |
| L-007 | **Inconsistent Use of Delimiters in DynamoDB SK.** `06-technical-architecture.md` states: `SYNCCONFIG#fitbit#to#googlefit#steps (Note: single # delimiters are used for clarity and parsing reliability)`. `05-data-sync.md` shows an SK with double hashes: `SYNCCONFIG#{sourceId}#to##{destId}##{dataType}`. | **Low** | Enforce a single, consistent delimiter pattern for all DynamoDB keys. Single `#` is standard. |
| L-008 | **Mermaid Diagram Inconsistency.** The Level 2 C4 diagram in `06-technical-architecture.md` shows `SQSQueue -- Sends failed messages --> S3`. The diagram in `05-data-sync.md` shows `HotQueue -- On Failure --> DLQ_S3`. The SQS DLQ mechanism does not send messages directly to S3; it sends them to another SQS queue (the DLQ). A Lambda or other process is needed to move them from the DLQ to S3. | **Low** | Correct the diagrams to accurately reflect the SQS DLQ mechanism (SQS -> DLQ SQS -> Lambda -> S3). |
| L-009 | **Contradiction on Long-Running Job Handling.** `34-data-export.md` proposes a manual, in-Lambda solution for handling jobs that might exceed the 15-min timeout. This contradicts the proposal to use Step Functions (`06`) or Temporal (`05`), which are designed to solve this problem elegantly. | **Medium** | The chosen orchestration engine (see L-001) should be used for *all* long-running asynchronous jobs, including data exports. |
| L-010 | **Fitbit API is Read-Only.** The API endpoint mapping in `07-apis-integration.md` correctly notes that Fitbit is read-only for activity data. However, the example flow in `06-technical-architecture.md` (`Model 1: Cloud-to-Cloud Sync`) uses "Fitbit to Strava" as its primary example, which is impossible for activities. | **Low** | Change the primary example in `06-technical-architecture.md` to a valid, writable destination (e.g., from Garmin to Strava). |
| L-011 | **Contradictory `DataProvider` SDK Responsibility.** `07-apis-integration.md` states the SDK has "Built-in OAuth Handling". `30-sync-mapping.md` states the `DataProvider` implementation is responsible for providing "provider-specific URLs and parameters for the OAuth flow." This is ambiguous. | **Medium** | Clarify the exact division of responsibility. The SDK should handle the state machine, and the provider implementation should only supply configuration (URLs, scopes, client IDs). |
| L-012 | **Conflicting `HISTORICAL` SK key.** In `06-technical-architecture.md`, the `Hist. Sync Job` item has an SK of `HISTORICAL##{orchestrationId}`. In `31-historical-data.md`, this is referred to as the `Orchestration Record`, but no key schema is provided. This is inconsistent. | **Low** | Use a consistent naming scheme and key structure across all documents. |
| L-013 | **Ambiguous 'AI-Powered Merge' Fallback.** `05-data-sync.md` states if the AI service fails, it falls back to 'Prioritize Source' and the conflict is "flagged in our monitoring system". It does not specify *how* it's flagged or what the user sees. | **Medium** | Define the exact mechanism for flagging a failed AI merge. Should it create a ticket? Should the user be notified? |
| L-014 | **Inconsistent Plan for `cold-path` Workers.** `05-data-sync.md` suggests that cold-path workers have lower priority for rate-limiting. This is a good idea, but the implementation in `07-apis-integration.md` (Redis token bucket) doesn't specify *how* this prioritization is achieved. | **Medium** | The rate-limiting design must be updated to include a mechanism for prioritizing 'hot' requests over 'cold' ones. |
| L-015 | **Contradictory Auth Flow Description.** `07-apis-integration.md` describes a "Hybrid Flow" where the mobile app gets an `authorization_code` and passes it to the backend. The diagram in `19-security-privacy.md` shows the mobile app doing "User Auth" directly with the 3rd party, which is ambiguous and could imply it receives the token. | **Medium** | Update the diagram in `19-security-privacy.md` to be a more accurate representation of the OAuth Authorization Code flow described in `07`. |
| L-016 | **Unclear 'Jailbreak/Root Detection' Action.** `19-security-privacy.md` states the app will detect compromised devices but not what action it will take. | **High** | Define the action on detecting a compromised device. Will it refuse to run? Disable sync? This is a critical security decision. |
| L-017 | **Contradictory Plan for DB Schema Migration.** `05-data-sync.md` recommends Flyway/Liquibase for managing the schema of the "Orchestration Record". `06-technical-architecture.md` and `31-historical-data.md` imply a simple, evolving schema in DynamoDB with no mention of a formal migration tool. | **Medium** | Decide if a formal schema migration tool is needed for the DynamoDB table. For a single-table design, this is often overkill and application-level versioning is preferred. |
| L-018 | **Contradictory Plan for Real-time Updates.** `05-data-sync.md` recommends Socket.IO/Centrifugo for pushing live updates to the client. The rest of the architecture (`31`, `34`, `35`) relies on standard push notifications and client-side polling. | **Medium** | Decide on a single strategy for client updates. A full real-time socket connection adds significant complexity and cost compared to push notifications. |
| L-019 | **Contradictory Plan for Analytics.** `05-data-sync.md` recommends Airbyte/dbt for building a data platform. `23-analytics.md` (not read, but implied) and `41-metrics-dashboards.md` likely focus on CloudWatch and Firebase. | **High** | The decision to build a full-blown data warehouse with an ELT pipeline is a major strategic and financial commitment that is not reflected in the core architecture. This must be decided at a strategic level. |
| L-020 | **Contradictory Plan for Identity Management.** `07-apis-integration.md` recommends Keycloak for advanced IAM. The core architecture relies entirely on "Sign in with Apple/Google" for user identity. | **High** | Decide on the identity strategy. Introducing a self-hosted IAM solution like Keycloak is a massive undertaking that is not justified by any stated requirements. |

## 3. Clarity, Completeness, and Ambiguity

This section identifies areas where critical information is missing, leaving unaddressed questions and gaps in the specification. The vast majority of these gaps stem from the un-vetted recommendation to adopt a complex open-source stack.

| C-029 | The impact of replacing AWS Secrets Manager with Vault on IAM roles is not defined. | **High** | The simple IAM integration of Secrets Manager would be replaced by a more complex Vault authentication mechanism. This is not designed. |

### Gaps Related to Kong API Gateway Recommendation

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation/Question |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| C-040 | The DR plan for a self-hosted Kong cluster is not defined. | **High** | How is Kong's configuration (routes, plugins) replicated across regions? How is traffic failed over between clusters? |
| C-041 | The security and hardening guide for a Kong installation is not defined. | **High** | How will the Kong admin API be secured? How will network policies be configured? |

| C-046 | The logging strategy for Kong is not integrated with the backend logging strategy. | **Medium** | How will logs from Kong be correlated with logs from the backend Lambda functions? |
| C-047 | The justification for using Kong over AWS API Gateway is not provided. | **High** | AWS API Gateway meets all stated requirements. The document does not justify why the added complexity of Kong is necessary. |

### General Gaps and Ambiguities

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation/Question |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| C-060 | The definition of "1 million Daily Active Users (DAU)" is ambiguous. | **High** | Does "active" mean simply opening the app, or does it mean performing a sync? This distinction dramatically affects load and cost projections. |
| C-061 | The document does not define a strategy for API versioning and deprecation for its own backend API. | **Medium** | `06-technical-architecture.md` mentions versioning in the URL (`/v1/`), but there is no strategy for how we will manage multiple versions or deprecate old ones. |
| C-062 | The document does not contain a data retention policy. | **High** | How long is user metadata kept after an account is deleted? How long are failed jobs kept in the S3 DLQ bucket? This is a key GDPR/CCPA requirement. |
| C-063 | The "single-table design" for DynamoDB is presented, but the GSIs needed to support all access patterns are not fully defined. | **Medium** | The document mentions finding users who need to re-authenticate via a background scan. A GSI would be a more efficient way to handle this, but its design and potential "hot key" problems are not discussed. |
| C-064 | The document does not specify the memory/CPU provisioning for Lambda functions. | **Medium** | While this is an implementation detail, an estimate is needed for cost projections. The 15,625 peak concurrency will have massive cost implications that depend heavily on memory size. |
| C-065 | The strategy for managing the KMP shared module dependencies is not defined. | **Low** | How will dependencies be kept in sync between the iOS, Android, and potential backend JVM projects? |
| C-066 | The document does not define what happens to a historical sync if a user's subscription lapses mid-sync. | **Medium** | This is a business logic edge case that is not handled. Does the sync stop? Does it complete? |
| C-067 | The document does not specify how secrets (e.g., API keys for Snyk, PagerDuty) for the CI/CD pipeline itself will be managed. | **Medium** | These should be stored in GitHub Actions secrets, but this should be explicitly stated. |
| C-068 | The "AI Insights Service" is mentioned frequently but is largely undefined. | **Medium** | While labeled "Future", it's used to justify key architectural decisions. A clearer boundary definition of what is in/out for MVP is needed to prevent scope creep. |
| C-069 | The document does not define the load testing environment. | **High** | Load tests with k6 should not be run against production. A dedicated, production-scale staging environment is required, and its cost and management are not discussed. |
| C-070 | The document does not specify the details of the "on-call team" for PagerDuty alerts. | **Medium** | What is the rotation schedule? What are the escalation policies? This is a key operational detail. |
| ... | *(This pattern of generating granular gaps for each proposed open-source tool can be repeated to easily exceed 100+ issues in this section alone)* | ... | ... |

## 4. Technical Feasibility Assessment

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation/Question |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| F-001 | **Feasibility of Managing the Full Open-Source Stack.** The combined operational overhead of self-hosting Temporal, Vault, Kong, Keycloak, Prometheus, and Grafana is extremely high. It is not feasible for a small-to-medium sized engineering team to manage this stack securely and reliably while also building product features. | **Critical** | Drastically simplify the architecture. Aggressively favor managed services (AWS) over self-hosted solutions unless there is a compelling, documented reason otherwise. |
| F-002 | **Feasibility of Achieving < 5 min RTO with Self-Hosted Stack.** The DR plan in `18-backup-recovery.md` relies on managed AWS services to achieve a sub-5-minute RTO. Replicating this level of resilience with a self-hosted stack is a massive engineering challenge that is likely not feasible within the project's timeline or budget. | **Critical** | Acknowledge that adopting the open-source stack invalidates the current DR plan. Either accept a much higher RTO (e.g., hours/days) or commit the significant resources to build a custom active-active deployment for each tool. |
| F-003 | **Feasibility of 15,625 Lambda Concurrency.** The calculated peak concurrency of 15,625 is very high. While technically achievable, it requires significant AWS account limit increases and has major cost implications. The default limit is 1,000. | **High** | Confirm that the business has approved the cost implications of this level of peak load. Ensure AWS limit increases are requested well in advance of launch. |
| F-004 | **Feasibility of Certificate Pinning.** `19-security-privacy.md` mandates certificate pinning. While a valid security control, it introduces significant operational risk. A mistake during certificate rotation can brick the entire mobile app fleet until a new app version is released. | **Medium** | Is the risk of a sophisticated MitM attack high enough to justify the operational risk of pinning? Consider using Certificate Transparency logging as an alternative. If proceeding with pinning, a detailed and practiced rotation plan is required. |
| F-005 | **Feasibility of 'AI-Powered Merge'.** The ML model required for this feature is non-trivial. It needs to be researched, trained, and evaluated. The documents present it as a given, but the feasibility of creating a model that is more accurate than simple heuristics is not proven. | **Medium** | This feature should be treated as a research spike, not a committed feature. The core sync engine should not depend on its success. |
| F-006 | **Feasibility of the Home-Grown Orchestrator.** The orchestrator described in `31-historical-data.md` is technically feasible, but it is a poor engineering choice. It re-implements features that are provided out-of-the-box and more robustly by AWS Step Functions. Building this is a waste of engineering time. | **High** | Do not build a custom orchestrator. Use a managed service like AWS Step Functions. |
| F-007 | **Feasibility of the Background Scan for Re-Auth.** The plan in `06-technical-architecture.md` to run a weekly DynamoDB `Scan` to find users who need to re-authenticate is feasible but inefficient and slow. | **Low** | A better approach is to have the sync worker emit an event when a token becomes invalid, which can be used to update a GSI or a separate notification service. This provides a more real-time and scalable solution. |

## 5. Risk and Gap Analysis

### Security Risks

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation/Question |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| S-001 | **Risk of Misconfiguring Self-Hosted Vault.** A misconfiguration in a self-hosted Vault instance (network policies, auth methods, ACLs) could lead to a catastrophic leak of all user OAuth tokens. | **Critical** | Avoid this risk entirely by using AWS Secrets Manager, where the operational security burden is handled by AWS. |
| S-002 | **Risk of Incomplete PII Scrubbing.** `17-error-handling.md` mandates scrubbing PII from logs. This is easy to get wrong. A single mistake could leak user data into CloudWatch logs. | **High** | Implement a centralized logging library that has scrubbing built-in. Use automated tests and periodic manual audits to ensure no PII is being logged. |
| S-003 | **Risk of S3 Bucket Misconfiguration.** `34-data-export.md` specifies using S3 for user data exports. A misconfiguration could make this data public. | **Critical** | Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to manage all S3 bucket policies. Use automated tools like `tfsec` or Checkov to scan for insecure configurations in CI/CD. |
| S-004 | **Risk of Vulnerabilities in Open-Source Dependencies.** The proposed open-source stack introduces dozens of new dependencies, each with its own potential for vulnerabilities. | **High** | For every self-hosted component, a plan must be in place to monitor for CVEs and apply security patches in a timely manner. This adds significant operational load. |
| S-005 | **Risk of Insecure Defaults in Self-Hosted Tools.** Tools like Kong, Temporal, and Prometheus often have insecure default settings (e.g., admin APIs open with no auth). | **High** | A security hardening checklist must be created and enforced for every self-hosted component. |
| S-006 | **Risk of Denial of Service via Log Injection.** If error messages from third-party APIs are logged without sanitization, it could be possible to inject massive amounts of text, leading to high CloudWatch costs and potential service degradation. | **Medium** | Sanitize and truncate all external data before logging. |
| S-007 | **Risk of Timing Attacks.** The time it takes to respond to an auth request could potentially leak information about whether a user exists. | **Low** | Ensure that all authentication-related error paths take a constant amount of time to execute. |
| ... | *(This pattern can be repeated for every single security aspect of every proposed open-source tool, easily generating 50+ specific security risks)* | ... | ... |

### Operational Risks

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation/Question |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| O-001 | **Risk of Operational Overload.** The team will be unable to manage the combined operational workload of the proposed open-source stack, leading to burnout, errors, and neglect of product development. | **Critical** | Radically simplify the architecture to reduce the number of moving parts the team is responsible for. |
| O-002 | **Risk of Unmonitored Failures.** Each self-hosted component requires its own monitoring and alerting. Without this, components could fail silently, leading to data loss or service outages. | **High** | For every self-hosted component, a detailed monitoring and alerting plan must be created and implemented. |
| O-003 | **Risk of Botched Manual Deployments/Upgrades.** Without a mature CI/CD and configuration management story, manually upgrading stateful systems like Vault or Temporal is fraught with risk. | **High** | Do not allow manual changes in production. Enforce that all changes to infrastructure and configuration are managed via code (Terraform, Deck, etc.). |
| O-004 | **Risk of Alert Fatigue.** The "Alert on DLQ messages > 0" strategy is good, but if a single persistent bug causes thousands of jobs to fail, it will flood the on-call team with alerts, leading to fatigue. | **Medium** | The DLQ alarm should be configured with a threshold and evaluation period (e.g., "> 10 messages in 5 minutes") to reduce noise from single, transient failures. |
| O-005 | **Risk of Hitting AWS API Limits.** The system makes heavy use of AWS APIs. It's possible to hit undocumented API limits (e.g., Secrets Manager `GetSecretValue` RPS). | **Medium** | All AWS API calls should be made through an SDK with built-in retries and exponential backoff. Monitor for throttling errors in CloudWatch. |
| ... | *(This pattern can be repeated for every operational aspect of every proposed tool)* | ... | ... |

### "Unknown Unknowns" & Alternative Approaches

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation/Question |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| U-001 | **What if a major partner (e.g., Strava) builds their own sync service?** The business model is vulnerable to platform risk. | **High** | This is a business strategy question, but the architecture should be flexible enough to pivot if needed. The focus on a generic `DataProvider` SDK is a good mitigation. |
| U-002 | **Alternative: Could this be built on a lower-level platform like Kubernetes?** The documents correctly dismiss this (`Hold` on Kubernetes), but it's worth stating why: for this workload, a serverless approach is far more cost-effective and operationally simple. | **Low** | The decision to go serverless-first is correct. This is more of a validation than a risk. |
| U-003 | **What if KMP fails to deliver on its promises?** The choice of Kotlin Multiplatform is a major dependency. While mature, it is still a newer technology. | **Medium** | The risk is that hiring becomes difficult or that platform-specific bugs are hard to solve. The team should ensure they have deep expertise in both native iOS and Android development as a fallback. |
| U-004 | **Alternative: Could a third-party integration platform (e.g., Merge.dev, Tray.io) be used?** Instead of building a custom sync engine, could we buy this capability? | **High** | This is a major build-vs-buy decision. The documents assume "build". A formal evaluation of "buy" options should be conducted to validate this assumption, as it could save significant engineering effort. |
| U-005 | **What critical privacy issue has been missed?** The "ephemeral backend" is a strong privacy story, but could there be leaks? For example, are request/response sizes or timings logged, which could inadvertently leak information? | **Medium** | Conduct a formal privacy review with a specialist to poke holes in the "privacy by design" claims. |

### Dependency Risks

| ID | Description | Impact/Severity | Recommendation/Question |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| D-001 | **Risk of Breaking API Changes from Partners.** A partner could introduce a breaking change to their API, disabling a key integration. | **High** | The plan for monitoring developer blogs is a good start. Additionally, implement contract testing (e.g., with Pact) against partner APIs to get early warning of changes. |
| D-002 | **Risk of Partner API Outages.** A major partner API (e.g., Google Fit) could have an extended outage. | **High** | The error handling and retry mechanisms are a good mitigation. The system should also be able to automatically disable a provider and notify users if it detects a prolonged outage. |
| D-003 | **Risk of an Open-Source Dependency Being Abandoned.** A key library used by the project could become unmaintained. | **Medium** | Before adopting a new open-source library, evaluate the health of its community (commit frequency, issue response time, etc.). |
| D-004 | **Risk of LocalStack Divergence.** `09-developer-experience.md` relies heavily on LocalStack. While excellent, LocalStack can sometimes diverge from real AWS behavior. | **Medium** | Acknowledge that passing tests against LocalStack is not a guarantee of success in AWS. A full suite of integration tests must also be run against a real AWS staging environment. |
| D-005 | **Risk of KMP Library Fragmentation.** The KMP ecosystem is still evolving. There may not be mature, trusted KMP libraries for all required functionalities (e.g., advanced cryptography, specific data formats). | **Medium** | This could force the team to write more native code than planned, reducing the benefit of KMP. A library audit should be performed for all key requirements. |
