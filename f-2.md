| ID | Document | Category | Description of Finding | Recommendation for Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ISSUE-101** | `05-data-sync.md` | Clarity | The document title is "PRD Section 5...". This is confusing as the file is an architecture/system design document, not a PRD. | Rename the title to "Data Synchronization & Reliability" to avoid confusion. |
| **ISSUE-102** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The document lists `../prd/GLOSSARY.md` as a dependency. The existence and correctness of this file should be verified. | Verify that the `GLOSSARY.md` file exists and is kept up-to-date. |
| **ISSUE-103** | `05-data-sync.md` | Clarity | The definition of "event chatter" as "more than 3 events for the same user within a 60-second window" seems arbitrary. | Provide the data or rationale that led to the specific "3 events in 60 seconds" definition for event chatter. |
| **ISSUE-104** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The mobile-initiated sync API accepts a `priority` field. The document does not specify what happens if an invalid priority is provided. | Specify the behavior of the sync API if an invalid value is provided for the `priority` field. |
| **ISSUE-105** | `05-data-sync.md` | Clarity | The adaptive polling strategy is based on "sync velocity". The document does not define how "sync velocity" is calculated. | Provide a precise formula or algorithm for calculating a user's "sync velocity". |
| **ISSUE-106** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The `PollingPreflightChecker` Lambda performs a cheap API call. The document should specify what happens if this pre-flight check call fails. | Define the error handling and retry logic for the `PollingPreflightChecker` Lambda's API call. |
| **ISSUE-107** | `05-data-sync.md` | Inconsistency | The sync algorithm says if the metadata list from the source is empty, the job is complete and `lastSyncTime` is updated. This could lead to a situation where a user's `lastSyncTime` is updated even if there was a temporary issue with the source API that caused it to return an empty list. | Consider adding a check to differentiate between "no new data" and "failed to fetch data" before updating `lastSyncTime`. |
| **ISSUE-108** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The "Sync Confidence" check uses a Redis counter. The document does not specify the TTL for this Redis key. | Specify a TTL for the "Sync Confidence" Redis keys to prevent them from living forever. |
| **ISSUE-109** | `05-data-sync.md` | Clarity | The "Sync Confidence" threshold is hardcoded to 10. The document should state if this is configurable. | Make the "Sync Confidence" threshold configurable via AWS AppConfig. |
| **ISSUE-110** | `05-data-sync.md` | Risk | The "all-or-nothing" failure handling for payload fetching could lead to a single bad record blocking all other valid records in a batch from being synced. | Consider a more granular failure handling mechanism that allows valid records in a batch to be processed even if one record fails the payload fetch. |
| **ISSUE-111** | `05-data-sync.md` | Inconsistency | The document states that for MVP, if a push to the destination is not 100% successful, the entire job is failed. This contradicts the `PushResult` data model, which is designed to handle partial failures. | Reconcile the MVP implementation with the `PushResult` data model. Either implement partial failure handling for MVP or simplify the data model. |
| **ISSUE-112** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The post-MVP strategy for partial failures is deferred to `45-future-enhancements.md`. This document should be reviewed to ensure it's not a stub. | Verify that `45-future-enhancements.md` contains a detailed strategy for handling partial failures. |
| **ISSUE-113** | `05-data-sync.md` | Clarity | The conflict detection threshold is a "configured threshold" with a default of 60 seconds. The document should specify where this is configured. | State that the conflict detection threshold is configured in AWS AppConfig and provide the key. |
| **ISSUE-114** | `05-data-sync.md` | Clarity | The `newest_wins` conflict resolution strategy has a tie-breaking rule where the source wins. It's not clear if this tie-breaking rule is logged for observability. | Specify that a `DEBUG` level log should be generated when the tie-breaking rule is applied in the `newest_wins` strategy. |
| **ISSUE-115** | `05-data-sync.md` | Risk | The resilience of the "Sync Confidence" cache relies on the assumption that a `pushData` operation will fail if there is a conflict. This might not always be true, depending on the destination API's behavior. | Analyze the behavior of each destination API to confirm that they will indeed return an error on a conflict, or redesign the resilience mechanism. |
| **ISSUE-116** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The `maxReceiveCount` for the SQS queue is set to 5. The document does not provide a rationale for this specific number. | Provide a rationale for choosing 5 as the `maxReceiveCount`. |
| **ISSUE-117** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The `VisibilityTimeout` for the SQS queue is set to 90 seconds. The document says this is "safely above the P95 latency for a single sync job". It should state what that P95 latency is. | Provide the P95 latency for a single sync job that was used to determine the 90-second `VisibilityTimeout`. |
| **ISSUE-118** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The user support flow for DLQ messages has an SLA of 24 hours for user communication. The document does not specify if this SLA is different for Pro and Free users. | Clarify if the 24-hour SLA for DLQ support is the same for all user tiers. |
| **ISSUE-119** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The user support flow mentions pre-defined email templates. The document should specify where these templates are stored and who is responsible for maintaining them. | Provide the location of the support email templates (e.g., in a specific repository or a customer engagement platform) and assign ownership for their maintenance. |
| **ISSUE-120** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The `PushResult` data model has a `failedItemIds` field. The document does not specify the maximum number of IDs that can be returned in this list. | Specify the maximum size of the `failedItemIds` list to prevent unbounded memory usage. |
| **ISSUE-121** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The sequence diagram for the delta sync is a good overview. However, it does not show the "Intelligent Hydration" steps (metadata fetch, then payload fetch). | Update the sequence diagram to accurately reflect the "Intelligent Hydration" workflow. |
| **ISSUE-122** | `05-data-sync.md` | Completeness | The `SyncConfig` data model is defined in a table. It should also be defined as a proper data class (e.g., in Kotlin) for type safety. | Provide a Kotlin data class definition for the `SyncConfig` object. |
| **ISSUE-123** | `05-data-sync.md` | Clarity | The `lastSyncTime` in `SyncConfig` is an ISO 8601 string. The document should be more specific about the required precision (e.g., milliseconds) and timezone format. | Specify the exact format for the `lastSyncTime` string, including precision and timezone requirements (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`). |

| **ISSUE-126** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The shared integration module provides a common set of exceptions. The document should specify if these are the only exceptions a `DataProvider` is allowed to throw. | Clarify if `DataProvider` implementations are restricted to throwing only the defined custom exceptions. |
| **ISSUE-127** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Clarity | The `RateLimitError` exception has an optional `retryAfterSeconds` property. The document should specify what the sync engine does if this property is null. | Define the sync engine's behavior when a `RateLimitError` is caught with a null `retryAfterSeconds` property. |
| **ISSUE-128** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The document mentions that a future iteration may introduce smaller, more focused interfaces (e.g., `ReadableDataProvider`). It should state if there is a ticket for this work. | If one exists, provide the ticket ID for the work to create more focused `DataProvider` interfaces. |
| **ISSUE-129** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The `DataProvider` interface has a `capabilities` field.

| **ISSUE-130** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Clarity | The `WebhookPayload` `dataType` must be a key from the "canonical data model registry". This registry is not defined. | Define the "canonical data model registry" and provide a link to it. |
| **ISSUE-131** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Inconsistency | The `pushData` method is supposed to handle casting errors gracefully and not fail the entire job. This contradicts the "all-or-nothing" approach for the "hot path" sync described in `05-data-sync.md`. | This is a major inconsistency. The product owner must decide on the desired behavior for partial failures in the MVP, and all related documents must be updated to reflect this single source of truth. |
| **ISSUE-132** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Clarity | The `hasNewData` method can return `null`, and the caller will assume `true`. The document should specify under which conditions a provider should return `null`. | Provide clear guidelines for `DataProvider` implementers on when to return `null` from the `hasNewData` method. |
| **ISSUE-133** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The `handleWebhook` method is responsible for verifying the webhook's authenticity. The document should specify a common library or utility for this to ensure consistency. | Provide a shared utility in the integration module for webhook signature verification. |
| **ISSUE-134** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The `DateRange` object uses ISO 8601 strings. It should specify if fractional seconds are supported. | Clarify whether the `DateRange` strings should include fractional seconds. |
| **ISSUE-135** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The process for updating the firewall allow-list requires a PR. The document should specify the required template for this PR. | Create a pull request template for firewall allow-list changes to ensure all necessary information is provided. |
| **ISSUE-136** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The hybrid auth flow mentions a `state` parameter that is a short-lived, signed JWT. The document does not specify the algorithm used to sign this JWT. | Specify the signing algorithm (e.g., HS256, RS256) for the `state` parameter JWT. |
| **ISSUE-137** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The auth flow mentions a redirect URI `syncwell://oauth-callback`. The document should specify if this is the only redirect URI or if there are others. | Provide a complete list of all valid OAuth redirect URIs. |
| **ISSUE-138** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | For non-OAuth integrations, an admin provisions keys directly into Secrets Manager. The process for this is not defined. | Document the end-to-end, audited procedure for an administrator to provision API keys in Secrets Manager. |
| **ISSUE-139** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The token auto-refresh logic throws a `PermanentAuthError` if a refresh fails. The document should specify if the user is notified immediately. | Clarify if a failed token refresh triggers an immediate push notification to the user. |

The document does not specify the content of this notification. | Provide the user-facing content for the rate-limiting delay notification. |
| **ISSUE-142** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The distributed rate limiting system uses a token bucket algorithm. The document should specify the initial number of tokens in the bucket. | Define the default initial token count for the rate-limiting token bucket. |
| **ISSUE-143** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The MVP API endpoint mapping defers Garmin integration and references ticket `PROD-1234`. The status of this ticket should be verified. | Verify the status of ticket `PROD-1234` in the issue tracking system. |
| **ISSUE-144** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The MVP API endpoint mapping shows Fitbit is "Read-only for activity data". The document should clarify if this is a limitation of the Fitbit API or a self-imposed limitation for the MVP. | Clarify the reason for the read-only limitation for Fitbit activity data. |
| **ISSUE-145** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Risk | The risk of a breaking API change is mitigated by "contract testing". This is too vague. | Specify the exact contract testing framework to be used (e.g., Pact) and the scope of the tests. |
| **ISSUE-146** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Risk | The risk of a vulnerability in a `DataProvider` leaking tokens is mitigated by code reviews. This is insufficient. | The mitigation should also reference the use of dynamic, narrowly-scoped IAM session policies as the primary technical control to prevent a `DataProvider` from accessing tokens it is not authorized for. |
| **ISSUE-147** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The risk of inconsistent `DataProvider` implementations is mitigated by a "QA certification suite". This suite is not defined. | Define the test cases and procedures for the `DataProvider` QA certification suite. |

| **ISSUE-150** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The Circuit Breaker pattern has a default configuration. The document should specify the process for tuning this configuration for a specific provider. | Define the process for performance testing and tuning the Circuit Breaker configuration for a new provider. |
| **ISSUE-151** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Completeness | The feature flags for graceful degradation are defined. The document does not specify who has permission to change these flags in production. | Define the IAM permissions required to modify the integration feature flags in AppConfig. |
| **ISSUE-152** | `07-apis-integration.md` | Clarity | The user-facing text for a disabled integration is "Temporarily Unavailable". This is vague. | Consider a more informative message, such as "This integration is temporarily unavailable due to an issue with the provider." |

The document does not specify the initial backoff delay or the maximum backoff delay. | Specify the initial and maximum backoff delays for the application-level retry mechanism. |
| **ISSUE-157** | `17-error-handling.md` | Inconsistency | The `maxReceiveCount` for the SQS DLQ is mentioned as being set to 5, referencing `05-data-sync.md`. This is consistent, which is good. However, this is redundant information. | Remove the redundant definition of `maxReceiveCount` and simply refer to `05-data-sync.md` as the source of truth. |
| **ISSUE-158** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The EventBridge rules are configured with their own DLQs. The document does not specify where these DLQ messages are stored or how they are monitored. | Specify the SQS queue used as the DLQ for EventBridge rules and add a CloudWatch alarm to monitor it. |
| **ISSUE-159** | `17-error-handling.md` | Clarity | The client-side logging rotates at 5MB with a max of 3 files (total 15MB). The document should state if this is configurable by the user. | Clarify if the client-side log size and rotation are user-configurable. |
| **ISSUE-160** | `17-error-handling.md` | Risk | Storing up to 15MB of logs on a user's device could be a significant use of storage, especially on older devices. | Re-evaluate the client-side log size limit and consider a smaller default or making it configurable. |
| **ISSUE-161** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The `correlationId` is the primary key for tracing. The document mentions manual propagation in the KMP logging library. It should specify which contexts require manual propagation. | Provide a list of specific asynchronous boundaries where manual propagation of the `correlationId` is required. |
| **ISSUE-162** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The "break-glass" procedure for accessing user data is mentioned as being documented in `19-security-privacy.md`. This link should be verified. | I have already found that the break-glass procedure in `19-security-privacy.md` is incomplete. I will add a finding here to reflect that this dependency is not met. |
| **ISSUE-163** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The log retention policy for CloudWatch is 30 days. The document does not specify the rationale for this number. | Provide a rationale for the 30-day CloudWatch log retention period (e.g., "to balance cost with the need for recent logs for debugging"). |
| **ISSUE-164** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The monitoring tooling includes Grafana dashboards at `https://grafana.syncwell.com/...`. This link cannot be verified. | Ensure the Grafana dashboard URL is correct and that the dashboard is properly configured and maintained. |

| **ISSUE-166** | `17-error-handling.md` | Inconsistency | The alert for `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` on the SQS queue is set to 5 minutes. This could be triggered by a legitimate rate-limiting backoff, which can be longer than 5 minutes. | Re-evaluate the 5-minute threshold for the `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` alert to avoid false positives caused by the rate-limiting backoff mechanism. |
| **ISSUE-167** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The error code dictionary is at `/shared/src/commonMain/resources/errors/error_codes.json`. The existence and correctness of this file should be verified. | Verify that the `error_codes.json` file exists, is well-formed, and is kept up-to-date. |

| **ISSUE-169** | `17-error-handling.md` | Risk | The `dlq_patterns.json` file is stored in S3. This is a critical configuration file. Storing it in S3 without version control is a major risk. | The `dlq_patterns.json` file should be stored in a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git) and deployed to S3 via a CI/CD pipeline. |
| **ISSUE-170** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The `dlq_patterns.json` file has a schema. This schema should be formally defined (e.g., as a JSON Schema) and validated in the CI/CD pipeline. | Create a JSON Schema for `dlq_patterns.json` and add a validation step to the CI/CD pipeline. |
| **ISSUE-171** | `17-error-handling.md` | Completeness | The `DLQAnalyzer` can redrive messages back to the main queue. The document does not specify what happens if a message is endlessly redriven (a "poison pill" message). | Implement a maximum redrive count for the `DLQAnalyzer` to prevent poison pill messages from causing infinite loops. |
| **ISSUE-172** | `17-error-handling.md` | Risk | The risk of a bug in the `DLQAnalyzer` is mitigated by unit tests. The document should also recommend integration tests. | Add a requirement for integration tests for the `DLQAnalyzer` that use a real SQS queue and DLQ. |
