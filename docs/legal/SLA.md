# SyncWell Service Level Agreement (SLA)

## 1. Overview
This Service Level Agreement (SLA) describes the service level commitments SyncWell provides for its Pro Tier subscribers. This SLA is an integral part of the SyncWell Terms of Service.

## 2. Definitions
*   **"Monthly Uptime Percentage"**: The total number of minutes in a calendar month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all incidents in that month, divided by the total number of minutes in that month.
*   **"Downtime"**: The time in which the core SyncWell API is unavailable, as measured by our internal monitoring systems. Downtime does not include unavailability resulting from scheduled maintenance or factors outside of our reasonable control (e.g., a major third-party provider outage).
*   **"Service Credit"**: A credit, calculated as a percentage of the monthly subscription fee, that will be applied to a future invoice.

## 3. Service Level Commitment
SyncWell will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the SyncWell API available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least **99.9%**.

## 4. Service Credits
If the Monthly Uptime Percentage falls below 99.9% in a given calendar month, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as follows:

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit Percentage |
| :--- | :--- |
| < 99.9% but >= 99.0% | 10% |
| < 99.0% | 25% |

### 4.1. Credit Request and Payment
To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a request by opening a ticket with our support team within 30 days of the month in which the Downtime occurred. The request must include the dates and times of the Downtime you are claiming. If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than 99.9% for the month, then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us.

## 5. Exclusions
This SLA does not apply to any unavailability, suspension, or termination of the SyncWell service, or any other SyncWell service performance issues:
*   That result from a suspension described in the Terms of Service.
*   Caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of SyncWell.
*   That result from any actions or inactions of you or any third party.
*   That result from your equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within our direct control).
*   Arising from our suspension and termination of your right to use the SyncWell Service in accordance with the Terms of Service.
*   Resulting from scheduled maintenance. We will provide at least 24 hours' notice for any scheduled maintenance.
