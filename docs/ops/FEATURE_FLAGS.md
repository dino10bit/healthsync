# Feature Flag Management Process

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the process for creating, managing, and retiring feature flags (also known as feature toggles) within the SyncWell application. Feature flags are a powerful tool for de-risking releases, enabling A/B testing, and allowing for dynamic control over application functionality without requiring a code deployment. A formal process for managing them is essential to prevent technical debt and ensure system stability.

## 2. Tooling
*   **Backend:** AWS AppConfig will be used for managing feature flags for our backend services.
*   **Mobile:** Firebase Remote Config will be used for managing feature flags for the iOS and Android applications.

## 3. Feature Flag Lifecycle

To prevent the accumulation of technical debt, all feature flags must follow this lifecycle.

### 3.1. Creation
1.  **Create a Ticket:** Before creating a flag, a Jira ticket must be created to track its lifecycle. The ticket should include a description of the feature being flagged and a **target removal date**.
2.  **Naming Convention:** Flags must follow a consistent naming convention: `[type]_[feature_name]_[platform]`.
    *   **Types:** `release` (for new features), `experiment` (for A/B tests), `ops` (for operational toggles).
    *   **Example:** `release_new_fitbit_api_backend`, `experiment_onboarding_copy_ios`.
3.  **Create the Flag:** The flag is created in the appropriate tool (AppConfig or Firebase) with its default value set to `false`.

### 3.2. Implementation
The flag is implemented in the codebase. The new code path is disabled by default. The pull request for the change must include a link to the Jira lifecycle ticket.

### 3.3. Testing
Both the "on" and "off" states of the feature flag must be tested as part of the normal QA process. Where possible, automated tests should be written for both code paths.

### 3.4. Rollout
The feature is rolled out to users by gradually increasing the percentage of users for whom the flag is enabled. This is done via the administrative console of AppConfig or Firebase.

### 3.5. Cleanup (Retirement)
This is the most critical step in the lifecycle. A feature flag is considered **technical debt** and must be removed once it is no longer needed.

1.  **Trigger:** Once a feature has been fully rolled out to 100% of users and has been deemed stable for at least one full release cycle, its lifecycle ticket should be marked as ready for cleanup.
2.  **Code Removal:** A developer creates a pull request that removes the conditional logic (`if/else`) from the application code, leaving only the new, permanent code path.
3.  **Flag Archival:** After the code is merged, the flag is archived or deleted from AppConfig/Firebase.
4.  **Close Ticket:** The Jira lifecycle ticket is closed.

**Policy:** No feature flag should exist for more than **3 months** without a formal review and justification. The SRE team will run a quarterly audit of all active feature flags to enforce this policy.
