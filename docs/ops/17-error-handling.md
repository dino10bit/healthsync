# Error Handling, Logging & Monitoring Strategy

## 1. Philosophy & Strategy

This document specifies the comprehensive strategy for error handling, logging, and monitoring for the entire SyncWell ecosystem. The goal is to build a highly resilient and observable system that can gracefully handle unexpected issues, provide clear feedback to the user, and give the engineering team powerful tools to diagnose and resolve problems quickly. This enterprise-grade approach uses structured logging, centralized error handling, and targeted alerting to ensure high service quality.

## 2. Error Handling Architecture

### 2.1. Client-Side Error Handling
A centralized `ErrorHandler` service, implemented as a singleton in the KMP shared module, will be the single point through which all application-level errors flow. Its primary interface is `handleError(error: Throwable, userContext: Map<String, String>)`. The `userContext` map must include standard keys such as `screenName`, `lastAction`, and `appVersion` to provide rich context for debugging.

### 2.2. Backend Error Handling
The backend's error handling strategy is designed for maximum resilience and message durability.

1.  **Guaranteed Delivery & Message Durability:** Jobs are published to a durable **Amazon SQS** queue. SQS guarantees that the message is stored redundantly until a worker successfully processes it.

2.  **Handling Transient Failures with Retries:**
    *   **Infrastructure-Level Retries:** The primary retry mechanism is the SQS queue itself. If a `WorkerLambda` execution fails, the message remains in the queue and is retried according to the Lambda event source mapping configuration.
    *   **Application-Level Retries:** Within the worker, specific critical API calls (like `ChangeMessageVisibility`) that must not fail will have their own internal retry loop (**3 attempts with exponential backoff**, with an initial delay of 100ms and a maximum delay of 1 second).
    *   **Advanced Resilience Patterns:** For predictable transient errors from third-party APIs, the application uses more advanced patterns like the **Circuit Breaker** and **Rate Limit Backoff**. These are authoritatively defined in `../architecture/07-apis-integration.md` and are not duplicated here.
    *   **Post-MVP (Cold Path):** For historical syncs, the Step Functions state machine provides its own declarative, automated retry logic, as detailed in `../prd/45-future-enhancements.md`.

3.  **Isolating Persistent Failures with a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ):**
    *   If a job fails all retry attempts, SQS automatically moves it to a pre-configured **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)**. The `maxReceiveCount` is authoritatively defined in `../architecture/05-data-sync.md`.
    *   This isolates the problematic job, allowing healthy jobs to continue processing.

4.  **EventBridge Durability:** The EventBridge rules that target SQS queues will also be configured with their own DLQs. These DLQs will be separate SQS queues (e.g., `eventbridge-rule-dlq`) and will have a CloudWatch alarm configured to trigger if any messages arrive, ensuring visibility into delivery failures.

## 3. Logging & Monitoring

### 3.1. Structured Logging Strategy

#### Client-Side Logging
The mobile app will maintain a local, rotating log file with structured JSON entries. To balance diagnostics with storage impact, the log file will rotate when it reaches **2MB**, and a maximum of **3 rotated files** (total 6MB) will be kept. This is not user-configurable.

#### Backend Logging
All backend services will output structured JSON logs to **AWS CloudWatch Logs**. A common logging library, based on the patterns from AWS Powertools, will be used across the backend to enforce this standard.

**Example Log Entry:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T14:30:00.123Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "Sync job failed: Unhandled exception from provider.",
  "service": "WorkerLambda",
  "correlationId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  ...
}
```
*   **Log Correlation:** The `correlationId` (from AWS X-Ray) is the primary key for tracing a request through the system. We will leverage AWS X-Ray for automatic propagation where possible. Manual propagation is required across asynchronous boundaries, such as when publishing to or consuming from SQS, to ensure the trace is not broken.
*   **PII Scrubbing & Traceability:** `userId` **must not be written to logs**. For rare cases requiring user-specific debugging, the secure "break-glass" procedure must be used. This is a strictly audited, high-privilege procedure for support engineers to access raw user data for critical debugging, requiring multi-person approval. The full procedure must be finalized in `../security/19-security-privacy.md` before launch.

### 3.2. Log Management at Scale
A tiered and sampled logging strategy will be used to manage costs, as defined in `../architecture/06-technical-architecture.md`.

*   **Log Levels:** Default to `INFO` in production. Dynamically adjustable to `DEBUG` via AWS AppConfig for targeted issue diagnosis.
*   **Log Retention and Archiving:** The following are the final, approved policies:
    *   **CloudWatch:** **30-day** retention to balance cost with the need for recent logs for debugging.
    *   **S3 (Long-term Archive):** Logs are automatically exported from CloudWatch to S3 via a **CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filter** pointing to a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.
    *   **S3 Glacier:** S3 Lifecycle policies transition logs to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after **1 year**.
*   **Log Analysis:** CloudWatch Logs Insights for recent logs, Amazon Athena for archived logs in S3.

### 3.3. Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

#### Client-Side Monitoring
*   **Tooling:** Firebase Crashlytics.
*   **Critical Alerts:** A newly detected crash type or a significant regression in the **99.8%** crash-free user rate SLO for a release.

#### Backend-Side Monitoring
*   **Tooling:** AWS CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, and Grafana. Live dashboards, whose URLs must be kept current, will be available at `https://grafana.syncwell.com/d/primary-dashboard`, as defined in [`./41-metrics-dashboards.md`](./41-metrics-dashboards.md).
*   **Alerting Flow:** CloudWatch Alarms → SNS → PagerDuty. The PagerDuty integration key and escalation policies are managed as secure secrets in the operations team's **1Password** vault.
*   **High-Priority Alert Triggers:**
    *   **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ):** Any message arriving in a DLQ.
    *   **Idempotency Key Collisions:** A custom CloudWatch metric (`Namespace: "SyncWell/Backend", MetricName: "IdempotencyKeyCollision", Unit: "Count", Dimensions: [service, operation]`) monitoring for a spike in suppressed duplicate requests.
    *   **Function & API Errors:** Spike in Lambda errors or 5xx API Gateway errors.
    *   **Queue Health:** `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` for the main SQS queue exceeds **15 minutes** to avoid false positives from legitimate rate-limiting backoffs.

## 4. Operational Runbooks & Procedures

### 4.1. Error Code Dictionary
A version-controlled dictionary, located at `/shared/src/commonMain/resources/errors/error_codes.json` in the application monorepo, is the single source of truth for error definitions. The example below is illustrative; the file itself is the complete source of truth.

**Example Entries:**
```json
{
  "FITBIT_TOKEN_EXPIRED": {
    "logLevel": "WARN",
    "userMessageKey": "errors.fitbit.reconnect_needed",
    "userAction": "NAVIGATE_TO_REAUTH_FITBIT"
  },
  "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR": {
    "logLevel": "ERROR",
    "userMessageKey": "errors.generic.internal_server_error",
    "userAction": "SHOW_SUPPORT_CONTACT_INFO"
  }
}
```

A catalogue mapping these keys to user-facing, localized strings is maintained in the mobile application's resource files.

### 4.2. DLQ Management Strategy (Semi-Automated)

A **semi-automated DLQ handling process** will be implemented to reduce operational load.

*   **DLQ Analyzer Lambda:** A dedicated Lambda function, the `DLQAnalyzer`, is triggered whenever a message arrives in the main `HotPathSyncDLQ`.
    *   **Technical Specifications:**
        *   **Language/Runtime:** Python 3.11
        *   **Memory:** 256MB
    *   **Event Source Mapping:** The `DLQAnalyzer` Lambda will be configured with the DLQ as its event source, with a `batchSize` of 10 and a `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds` of 60.

*   **Automated Triage Logic:** The `DLQAnalyzer` inspects the message's error metadata and attempts to identify specific, well-understood failure patterns from a configuration file.
    *   **Configuration Management:** The `dlq_patterns.json` file must be stored in the application's main Git repository and deployed to S3 via a secure CI/CD pipeline. It must not be edited directly in S3.
    *   **Schema Validation:** The CI/CD pipeline must include a step to validate the `dlq_patterns.json` file against a formal JSON Schema to prevent deployment of misconfigured rules.
    *   **Pattern Matching:** If an error matches a known regex pattern in the config file, the analyzer takes the configured action. For example, a known transient error will be automatically redriven back to the main queue after a **3600 second (1 hour)** delay.
    *   **Poison Pill Prevention:** To prevent infinite redrive loops, the analyzer will add a custom `x-redrive-count` attribute to the message. If this count exceeds a maximum of **3**, the message will be archived instead of redriven.
    *   **Archiving:** Unrecoverable errors are archived to `s3://syncwell-prod-dlq-archive/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/`.
    *   **Schema for `dlq_patterns.json`:**
        ```json
        {
          "patterns": [
            {
              "patternName": "Third Party Timeout",
              "log_regex": ".*ThirdPartyTimeoutException.*",
              "action": "redrive",
              "delaySeconds": 3600
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

*   **Alerting for Unknown Failures:** If a message's error does not match any known patterns, the `DLQAnalyzer` triggers a high-priority alert by publishing a message to a dedicated SNS topic (`DLQ_UnknownError_Alert`), which then fans out to PagerDuty and Slack.

## 5. Risk Analysis

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-30** | A bug in the `DLQAnalyzer` causes it to misclassify errors (e.g., drop a critical error or endlessly retry a permanent one). | Medium | High | The `DLQAnalyzer` must have its own suite of unit and integration tests covering all known patterns. The integration tests must use a real SQS queue and DLQ. Any new pattern added to the config file requires a corresponding test case. A CloudWatch alarm will monitor the Lambda's error rate. |
| **R-31** | A bug in a service or a misconfiguration leads to excessive logging, causing a significant, unexpected cost increase. | Medium | Medium | AWS Cost Anomaly Detection will be configured for CloudWatch services. A specific budget of **$5,000/month** for CloudWatch with an alert threshold of **80%** will be configured in AWS Budgets to notify finance and engineering leads. |
