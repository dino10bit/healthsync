# PRD Section 24: Help Center, Support & Feedback

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the comprehensive operational plan for SyncWell's user support systems. It establishes a multi-tiered strategy designed to empower users, provide efficient and empathetic assistance when needed, and systematically channel user feedback into the product development lifecycle.

For the **solo developer**, this document is a blueprint for building a scalable and sustainable support system. It details the philosophy, tools, and automated workflows necessary to manage user communications effectively without being overwhelmed, turning support from a simple cost center into a powerful engine for product insight and user retention.

## 2. Support Philosophy

*   **Empower First, Then Assist:** Our primary goal is to empower users to solve their own problems through a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate self-service portal (Tier 0). Direct assistance (Tier 1) is reserved for issues that cannot be self-resolved.
*   **Support as a Product Insight Engine:** Every support ticket is an opportunity. We will not just solve the user's immediate problem; we will analyze the root cause and feed that insight back into the development process to prevent the problem from recurring for other users.

## 3. Tiered Support Model

### Tier 0: Self-Service (The First Line of Defense)

*   **Channel 1: Interactive AI Troubleshooter:** This is the user's first stop for any problem. Powered by the `AI Insights Service` (see `06-technical-architecture.md`), this agent engages the user in a conversation to diagnose their issue.
    *   **Technology:** Built with LangGraph to create a stateful, intelligent conversational flow.
    *   **Capabilities:**
        *   Asks clarifying questions to narrow down the problem.
        *   Can be granted permission to run read-only "health checks" on the user's sync connections.
        *   Provides step-by-step, interactive guidance to resolve the issue.
        *   If unable to resolve, it intelligently summarizes the problem and the steps already taken, and seamlessly hands the user off to the best-next-step (a specific Help Center article or pre-filling a Tier 1 ticket).
*   **Channel 2: In-App Help Center:** A searchable database of articles, tutorials, and troubleshooting guides. This serves as a secondary resource and a destination for users who prefer to read documentation.
    *   **Content Strategy:**
        *   **Troubleshooting Guides:** Step-by-step solutions for common errors (e.g., "How to Fix a Failing Sync").
        *   **How-To Guides:** Walkthroughs for key features (e.g., "How to Configure Historical Sync").
        *   **Conceptual Explainers:** Articles explaining *why* something works the way it does (e.g., "Understanding Read-Only Integrations").
    *   **Process:** New articles will be prioritized based on the frequency of related support tickets. All articles will be reviewed quarterly for accuracy.
*   **Channel 3: Public Feedback Portal (Canny.io):** Serves as a community forum where users can see that others may be having the same issue or have the same idea, reducing duplicate tickets.

### Tier 1: Direct Assistance

*   **Channel: Email & In-App Form:** All direct support requests are funneled into a single help desk system (**Freshdesk** is the recommended tool for its automation features and generous free tier).
*   **Service Level Objective (SLO):** First response to all new tickets within **24 business hours**.
*   **Voice and Tone Guide:** All written communication will be:
    *   **Empathetic:** Acknowledge the user's frustration first. ("I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with...")
    *   **Clear & Concise:** Use simple language. Avoid technical jargon. Use bullet points and bold text to make instructions easy to follow.
    *   **Technical & Credible:** As the developer, provide accurate, direct answers.

## 4. Help Desk Automation Workflow (Freshdesk)

To manage ticket volume efficiently, the following automation rules will be configured:

1.  **Ticket Creation:** When a ticket is created via the "Report a Problem" form, the attached metadata (app version, OS version) will be automatically added as ticket properties.
2.  **Keyword-Based Tagging:** Tickets will be automatically tagged based on keywords in the subject or body (e.g., "Fitbit" -> `fitbit` tag, "payment" -> `billing` tag).
3.  **Canned Responses:** A library of pre-written responses for the top 10-15 most common issues will be created to allow for rapid, consistent replies.

## 5. The "Report a Problem" Flow

This is the most critical workflow for efficient debugging.

1.  User navigates to `Help Center > Report another problem`.
2.  A form is displayed asking for a subject and description. The user's email, app version, and OS version are pulled automatically.
3.  A checkbox, **ticked by default**, states: "Attach anonymous debugging information to help us solve your problem faster."
4.  When submitted, the Freshdesk API is called to create a ticket with all the metadata and the sanitized, PII-free JSON log file attached.
5.  The user receives a confirmation that their ticket has been received.

## 6. KPIs / Success Metrics

*   **Ticket Deflection Rate:** `(Number of Help Center article views) / (Number of tickets created)`. A primary measure of self-service success.
*   **First Contact Resolution Rate:** % of tickets resolved in a single developer reply. Goal: >70%.
*   **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** Measured via a one-click survey in the ticket resolution email. Goal: >90%.
*   **Tickets per 1,000 DAU:** A measure of support scalability. Goal is to keep this stable or decreasing over time.

## 7. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Flowchart] Support Ticket Lifecycle:** A detailed flowchart showing a ticket's journey from submission, through the automation rules, to developer response and final resolution.
*   **[Mockup] Help Desk Dashboard:** A mockup of the Freshdesk dashboard showing the ticket queue, tags, and key metrics.
*   **[Table] Content Plan for Help Center:** A table listing the top 15 planned articles for the Help Center at launch.
*   **[Diagram] Tiered Support Model:** A diagram visually representing Tier 0 and Tier 1 support channels and the flow of users between them.

## 8. Engineering Escalation Process
This section defines the process for escalating issues from the Tier 1 support team to the engineering team.

### 8.1. When to Escalate
A support ticket should be escalated to engineering when:
*   The issue is a confirmed, reproducible bug in the application.
*   The issue requires technical investigation that the support agent cannot perform (e.g., analyzing backend logs).
*   The issue is related to a production incident (e.g., a service outage).

### 8.2. Escalation Procedure
1.  **Create a Jira Ticket:** The support agent creates a new ticket in the appropriate Jira project (e.g., `BE` for backend, `MOB` for mobile).
2.  **Link the Tickets:** The agent links the Jira ticket to the original support ticket in Freshdesk.
3.  **Provide Context:** The Jira ticket description **must** include:
    *   A clear and concise summary of the issue.
    *   Steps to reproduce the bug.
    *   The user's `userId` (if applicable and the user has consented).
    *   A link back to the Freshdesk ticket.
    *   Any relevant logs or attachments.
4.  **Triage:** The engineering team lead for the relevant project is responsible for triaging all new escalated tickets on a daily basis and assigning them to an engineer.

### 8.3. Communication Loop
*   The support agent remains the primary point of contact for the user.
*   When the engineering team provides updates in the Jira ticket, the support agent is responsible for communicating those updates back to the user in a clear, non-technical way.
*   When the Jira ticket is resolved, the support agent is notified and can then inform the user that the issue has been fixed. This "closes the loop" and is critical for a good user experience.
