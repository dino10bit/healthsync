# PRD Section 21: Risks, Constraints & Mitigation

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a consolidated and actively managed register of the most critical risks facing the SyncWell project. Its purpose is to move from a reactive "fire-fighting" mindset to a proactive, professional approach to risk management. We identify, assess, and plan for potential problems before they occur.

This living document is a strategic dashboard of the primary challenges that require focus. For the **solo developer**, it is a tool for prioritizing mitigation efforts and preparing contingency plans. For **investors**, it demonstrates foresight, maturity, and a clear-headed approach to navigating and mitigating uncertainty.

## 2. Risk Management Framework

### 2.1. Risk Assessment Matrix

Risks are assessed and prioritized based on their Probability and Impact, resulting in a Risk Level.

| Probability | Impact: Low | Impact: Medium | Impact: High | Impact: Critical |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | Medium | High | High | Critical |
| **Medium** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Low** | Low | Low | Medium | High |

### 2.2. RACI Matrix

For a solo developer, the RACI matrix clarifies the different roles they must play.

| Task / Area | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mitigating Technical Risks** | Developer | Developer | (External Mentor/Peer) | Users (via Changelog) |
| **Mitigating Legal Risks**| Developer | Developer | Legal Counsel | Users (via Policy Updates)|
| **Mitigating Market Risks**| Product Manager | Product Manager | Users (via Feedback) | (Investors) |
| **Managing Burnout**| Individual | Individual | (Family/Mentor) | - |

*   **Note on Solo-Developer Context:** For a solo developer, this RACI matrix serves as a conceptual tool rather than a literal delegation matrix. Its purpose is to explicitly acknowledge the different "hats" the developer must wear (e.g., acting as the 'Developer', the 'Product Manager', the 'Legal Counsel'). This helps in consciously switching contexts and ensuring that all aspects of a task (e.g., the legal implications of a feature) are considered.

## 3. Consolidated Risk Register

This register categorizes and assesses the top risks to the project.

| ID | Category | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R-19 | **External Dependency**| A third-party API provider makes a breaking change, disabling a key integration. | **High** | **High** | **High** |
| R-59 | **External Dependency**| SyncWell exhausts a third-party API's rate limit, causing widespread sync failures for that provider. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-55 | **Security** | A vulnerability in the backend leads to a leak of user OAuth tokens from Secrets Manager. | **Low** | **Critical** | **High** |
| R-62 | **Architecture** | A "cache stampede" event (e.g., after a deployment) causes a sudden, massive load on DynamoDB, leading to throttling and failures. | **Low** | **High** | **Medium** |
| R-63 | **Architecture** | Cross-region data replication lag for DynamoDB or Secrets Manager exceeds the RPO, leading to data inconsistencies during a failover. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| R-64 | **Architecture** | A sudden, massive influx of sync requests (e.g., due to a viral event) or a temporary downstream service outage overwhelms the worker fleet, causing processing delays. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| R-37 | **Human Resources** | The solo developer experiences burnout, leading to a significant project slowdown. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-14 | **Technical/OS** | Changes in platform background execution policies break automatic syncing. | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |
| R-04 | **Market** | The product fails to gain traction and attract a sufficient user base to be viable. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| R-61 | **Product/UX** | The addition of numerous power-user features leads to a complex UI that alienates the core, less-technical user persona. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| R-65 | **Human Resources** | The solo developer is a single point of failure for on-call incident response, creating a significant operational risk. | **High** | **High** | **High** |
| R-66 | **Strategic** | The deep integration with AWS-specific managed services creates a high degree of vendor lock-in, making a future migration to another cloud provider difficult and expensive. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| R-67 | **Architecture** | The use of AWS Fargate introduces operational overhead for building, publishing, and monitoring container images, which is more complex than the serverless Lambda deployment model. | **Medium** | **Low** | **Low** |
| R-68 | **Architecture** | A single "viral user" generates extremely high traffic, causing their own requests to be throttled by DynamoDB due to a hot partition. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| R-69 | **Architecture** | **[RISK-CRITICAL-01]** The cost of the Lambda-based compute model at peak load is significant and highly sensitive to payload sizes and sync frequency. | **Medium** | **Critical** | **Critical** |
| R-70 | **External Dependency** | **(DEFERRED)** The potential Garmin integration relies on an unofficial API. This risk was deemed too high for the MVP and the integration has been deferred. | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |
| R-71 | **External Dependency** | **[RISK-HIGH-03]** The use of Firebase Authentication creates a hard dependency on a non-AWS service for a critical function (user login). | **Low** | **High** | **High** |
| R-72 | **External Dependency** | Third-party webhook notifications are not guaranteed to be delivered, or may be significantly delayed, leading to stale data for users on the push-based model. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| R-73 | **Architecture** | The adaptive polling algorithm is complex and may be difficult to tune correctly, leading to either inefficient polling (high cost) or syncs that are too infrequent (poor UX). | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| R-74 | **Architecture** | **[R-001]** A failure to access critical configuration (e.g., DynamoDB table name) from AWS AppConfig at application startup could prevent the service from running. | **Low** | **High** | **High** |
| R-75 | **Security** | **[R-002]** A compromised and revoked JWT public key could be considered valid by the Authorizer Lambda for up to 1 hour due to caching. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| R-76 | **Architecture** | **[R-003]** During a rate-limit backoff, the SQS `ChangeMessageVisibility` API call could fail repeatedly, potentially causing a job to be lost if not handled correctly. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |

## 4. Detailed Mitigation & Contingency Plans

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan (If Risk Occurs) | Contingency Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rate Limit Exhaustion (R-59)** | - Implement the **distributed, global rate limiting** system using ElastiCache.<br>- Configure conservative limits for each provider in the `DataProvider` SDK.<br>- Prioritize real-time syncs over historical backfills when the limit is approached. | - The rate limiter will automatically throttle requests, delaying jobs rather than failing them.<br>- If limits are too low, they can be adjusted in configuration without a full deployment. | The rate limiter's "throttled requests" metric spikes. |
| **Cache Stampede (R-62)** | - **Implement Cache Expiration Jitter:** All cache keys will be set with a randomized TTL. Instead of a fixed TTL (e.g., 60 minutes), the TTL will be a random value between a specified min and max (e.g., `random(55, 65)` minutes). This small, random offset ensures that a large number of keys set at the same time do not expire simultaneously, spreading the load on the database over time.<br>- **Implement Cache Warming for Deployments:** A post-deployment script in the CI/CD pipeline will be created. This script will identify a subset of the most frequently accessed cache keys (e.g., based on analytics data) and pre-populate the cache with fresh data for these keys. This prevents an initial "thundering herd" problem immediately following a deployment where the cache is cold.<br>- **Use a "Fetch-on-Miss with Locking" Strategy:** The application code will use a distributed lock (via ElastiCache for Redis) when a cache miss occurs. If multiple requests for the same key miss the cache simultaneously, only the first request will acquire the lock and be allowed to fetch the data from the database. The other requests will wait for the first one to complete and populate the cache. This directly prevents a cache stampede at the application level. | - Rely on DynamoDB On-Demand Capacity to absorb the initial spike.<br>- Manually trigger a cache-warming process if needed. | A sudden spike in DynamoDB read throttling immediately following a deployment. |
| **System Overload (R-64)** | - The architecture uses **Amazon SQS queues** as a buffer between the ingestion layer (API Gateway) and the **AWS Lambda worker service** for the "Hot Path". This queue acts as a shock absorber.<br>- AWS Lambda will automatically scale its concurrent executions based on the SQS queue depth.<br>- This serverless design ensures that even a massive spike in requests will not lead to lost jobs, only a temporary increase in processing latency. | - The system is designed to handle this automatically. The queue will absorb the load, and Lambda will scale out to process it.<br>- SQS queue depth and Lambda concurrency/throttles are key metrics on our monitoring dashboard. | A sustained, rapid increase in the `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` metric for the primary SQS queue. |
| **Breaking API Change (R-19)** | - Implement robust API error monitoring and alerting.<br>- Maintain a modular `DataProvider` architecture for rapid fixes.<br>- Use contract testing in CI/CD to detect potential breaking changes early. | - Immediately disable the failing integration in-app with a message to users.<br>- Communicate the issue and ETA for a fix via the app's status page.<br>- Prioritize and deploy a hotfix release. | An API error rate for a specific provider spikes by >50% for more than 1 hour. |
| **Developer Burnout (R-37)** | - Adhere to a sustainable pace.<br>- Automate repetitive tasks (testing, CI/CD).<br>- Take scheduled time off. | - Temporarily halt new feature development.<br>- Focus only on critical bug fixes and support.<br>- Communicate a development slowdown to users if necessary. | Developer consistently misses sprint goals for more than two consecutive sprints due to exhaustion. |
| **Security Breach (R-55)** | - Adhere strictly to security best practices (Keychain, etc.).<br>- Commission a pre-launch third-party security audit. | - Immediately force-logout all users of the affected integration.<br>- Deploy a hotfix to patch the vulnerability.<br>- Transparently communicate the nature of the breach and the remediation steps to all users. | Discovery of a critical vulnerability, either internally or via external report. |
| **Market Failure (R-04)**| - Launch with a focused MVP.<br>- Use a public feedback portal to build what users want. | - Analyze user feedback and analytics to identify the biggest gaps.<br>- Pivot the product roadmap to address these gaps.<br>- If still no traction, consider open-sourcing the project or initiating a shutdown. | Paid user growth is flat for more than three consecutive months post-launch. |
| **DynamoDB Hot Partition (R-68)** | - The primary mitigation is the **"hot table" strategy**. A viral user can be flagged, and their data will be moved to a dedicated DynamoDB table with higher provisioned throughput. This isolates their traffic and avoids read-side complexity.<br>- Application logic will check the user's flag and route DB queries to the correct table. | - If the "hot table" strategy is insufficient, the more complex **write-sharding** strategy can be implemented for that user. | A single user's API requests experience sustained DynamoDB throttling errors, confirmed via CloudWatch metrics. |
| **Lambda Cost Model Sensitivity (R-69)** | - The reconciled cost model in `66-costs-model.md` provides a detailed, bottom-up estimate.<br>- Mandatory application-level optimizations (tiered logging, metadata-first hydration) are defined in the architecture to control variable costs.<br>- A private beta is required to validate traffic assumptions before public launch. | - If real-world traffic exceeds nominal projections, the budget must be re-evaluated.<br>- Savings Plans will be purchased to reduce baseline compute costs post-beta. | The reconciled cost model is approved, but the risk remains active until traffic assumptions are validated by the private beta. |
| **Garmin API Instability (R-70)** | - **Mitigation Complete:** The formal decision was to **defer the Garmin integration**. It has been removed from the MVP scope in all relevant PRDs. This risk will be re-evaluated if and when an official API becomes available. | - N/A | N/A |
| **Firebase Auth Dependency (R-71)** | - **Accepted Risk for MVP:** This is an accepted trade-off to accelerate MVP development.<br>- **Draft Exit Strategy:** A high-level migration plan to a different provider (e.g., Amazon Cognito) is documented in `../architecture/33a-firebase-exit-strategy.md`. | - If a major Firebase outage occurs, communicate with users via status page and social media.<br>- Activate the pre-planned migration strategy if the outage is prolonged. | A major, prolonged outage of Firebase Authentication is announced by Google. |
| **Webhook Unreliability (R-72)** | - **Hybrid Approach:** The system will not rely exclusively on webhooks. A periodic, low-frequency polling job (e.g., every 24 hours) will run for all users as a fallback to catch any missed webhook events.<br>- **Monitoring:** A custom metric will track the time since the last webhook was received for each provider. An alert will fire if no webhooks are received for an extended period (e.g., >6 hours), indicating a potential systemic issue with the provider's notification system. | - If a provider's webhook system is down, the system will automatically fall back to the adaptive polling mechanism for affected users.<br>- Communicate the issue on the app's status page. | The "time since last webhook" alert is triggered for a specific provider. |
| **Adaptive Polling Complexity (R-73)** | - **Start Simple:** The initial algorithm for adaptive polling will be simple and based on clear heuristics (e.g., "if last sync was > 7 days ago, poll weekly").<br>- **A/B Testing:** The parameters of the algorithm (e.g., polling intervals) will be managed in AppConfig and can be A/B tested to find the optimal balance between cost and data freshness.<br>- **Monitoring:** Dashboards will be created to monitor the effectiveness of the algorithm, tracking metrics like "empty polls vs. successful polls". | - If the algorithm is found to be ineffective, it can be disabled via a feature flag in AppConfig, causing the system to revert to the simple tiered polling model (daily for Free, 15-min for Pro).<br>- The algorithm can then be refined and re-deployed without affecting the user experience. | The "empty poll" rate exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 95%) for a sustained period. |

## 5. Execution Plan
Risk management is a continuous process integrated into the agile development cycle.

1.  **Initial Mitigation:** The execution plans outlined in the relevant sections of this PRD serve as the initial mitigation tasks.
2.  **Sprint-Level Review:** At the beginning of each sprint, the developer will briefly review if any planned stories significantly impact the project's risk profile.
3.  **Quarterly Deep Dive:** A more formal review of this entire document will be conducted quarterly to update risk assessments and adjust mitigation plans.
