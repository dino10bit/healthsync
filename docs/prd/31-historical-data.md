# PRD: Historical Data Sync

*   **Status:** `Draft`
*   **Priority:** `P1 (High)` for Post-MVP v1.1 Release
*   **Owner:** Product Manager

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the requirements for the **Historical Data Sync** feature. This is a core premium offering that allows users to perform a one-time, large-scale backfill of their historical health data from a connected provider. This feature is a key driver for monetization, providing a powerful incentive for users to upgrade to the **Pro subscription tier**, as defined in `11-monetization.md`.

The "Cold Path" architecture, detailed in `../architecture/06-technical-architecture.md`, uses AWS Step Functions to handle these long-running, asynchronous jobs reliably and cost-effectively.

*   **Target Audience:** New users who want to import their complete history, and data-conscious users who want a complete, unified record of their health data in one place.
*   **Business Goal:** Increase Pro tier conversion rate by **15%** within 6 months of launch.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   Number of historical syncs initiated per week > 1,000.
    *   Job completion success rate > 98%.
    *   P90 completion time for a 1-year backfill < 4 hours.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Persona | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US-30** | As a new Pro user (Alex), I want to import my entire multi-year history from my previous fitness app, so that all my data is in one place and I can see long-term trends. | Alex (The Power User) | Must-Have (P0) |
| **US-31** | As a new user (Sarah), I want the app to automatically sync the last 7 days of my data upon setting up a new connection, so I can see immediate value and confirm it's working without manually running a full historical sync. | Sarah (The New User) | Should-Have (P1) |
| **US-32** | As a user (Alex), if my large historical sync finishes with some errors, I want to clearly see which parts failed and be able to retry them easily, so I don't have to re-run the entire sync. | Alex (The Power User) | Should-Have (P1) |

## 3. User Journey & UI/UX

The detailed user journey and flow diagrams are maintained in `../ux/38-ux-flow-diagrams.md`. UI/UX mockups are available in **Figma (link: figma.com/file/...)**.

1.  **Discovery:** A Pro user discovers the "Import History" feature on a connection's settings screen.
2.  **Initiation:** The user selects a date range (e.g., "Last 2 years", "All time").
3.  **Confirmation:** The app displays an estimated time and a warning about potential API limitations. The user confirms.
4.  **In-Progress:** The app shows a persistent, non-blocking status indicator (e.g., "Importing your history... 25% complete"). The user can leave this screen and use the rest of the app.
5.  **Completion:** The user receives a push notification upon completion (success or failure).
6.  **Error Handling:** If there are partial failures, the results screen provides a "Retry Failed Items" button.

## 4. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FR-1** | User must be able to select a date range for the sync. | Options: "Last 30 Days", "Last Year", "All Time", "Custom Range". |
| **FR-2** | System must provide an estimated time to completion. | Based on date range size and provider-specific heuristics. |
| **FR-3** | System must show in-progress status. | Updated via polling the job status endpoint. |
| **FR-4** | System must send a push notification on completion. | `N-05`: "Your historical sync is complete." or `N-06`: "Your historical sync finished with some errors." |
| **FR-5** | System must support partial retries. | The backend must track per-chunk success/failure. |
| **FR-6** | The backend must be asynchronous and idempotent. | Uses AWS Step Functions and a client-provided idempotency key. |
| **FR-7** | The feature must be restricted to Pro tier users. | The API must reject requests from non-Pro users with a `403 Forbidden`. |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Metric | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NFR-1** | Reliability | Job Success Rate | > 98% |
| **NFR-2** | Performance | P90 Completion Time (1-year sync) | < 4 hours |
| **NFR-3** | Scalability | Concurrent Jobs | > 100 |
| **NFR-4**| Cost | Cost per 1-year sync | < $1.00 |

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A Pro user can successfully initiate, monitor, and complete a 1-year historical sync.
- [ ] A non-Pro user is shown an upsell message and is blocked from initiating a sync.
- [ ] If a sync job is interrupted and retried, it does not create duplicate data.
- [ ] If one chunk of a 12-chunk sync fails, the user is notified of a partial failure and can retry just the failed chunk.
- [ ] All success and failure metrics are correctly tracked in our analytics dashboard.

## 7. Risk Analysis

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-71** | High cloud costs from inefficient queries or very large backfills. | Medium | High | Implement cost monitoring and alerts. Use Fargate Spot for workers. Validate cost assumptions with load testing. |
| **R-72** | Hitting third-party API rate limits during large backfills. | High | Medium | Use a configurable concurrency limit in the Step Functions `Map` state. Implement exponential backoff. |
| **R-73** | A bug in the `Process Chunk Worker` causes silent data corruption. | Low | High | Implement data validation checks and "golden file" comparison in the CI/CD pipeline. |
