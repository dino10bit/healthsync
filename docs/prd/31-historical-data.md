# PRD Section 31: Historical Data Handling (Post-MVP)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document describes the **Historical Data Sync** feature, which is a core premium offering planned for a **post-MVP release**. This feature will allow paying users to backfill their health data, providing a powerful incentive to upgrade.

The implementation details and architectural designs for this feature, including the use of AWS Step Functions for orchestration, have been deferred from the initial MVP to reduce scope and risk. The complete, detailed technical specification is now maintained in **`45-future-enhancements.md`**. This document serves as a high-level placeholder.

## 2. Feature Status

*   **Priority:** Should-Have (S-1)
*   **Status:** Deferred (Post-MVP)
*   **Rationale for Deferral:** The implementation of a robust, long-running workflow using AWS Step Functions adds significant complexity to the MVP. Deferring this feature allows the team to focus on the core "Hot Path" sync engine first, ensuring its reliability before adding more complex features.
*   **Detailed Design:** See `45-future-enhancements.md`, Section 6, "Deferred Architectural Designs from PRD-06".
