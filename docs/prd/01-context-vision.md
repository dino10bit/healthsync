# PRD Section 1: Context & Vision

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic context and product vision for **SyncWell**, a cross-platform health and fitness data synchronization application for Android and iOS. In the fragmented digital health market, users often invest in multiple devices and applications (e.g., a Garmin watch for running, an Oura ring for sleep, a Fitbit for daily tracking). This creates data silos, preventing users from seeing a holistic view of their health and forcing manual, error-prone data entry. SyncWell addresses this critical pain point by providing a secure, reliable, and user-friendly "digital bridge" between these services.

Inspired by the proven market success of Health Sync, SyncWell aims to capture a significant market share by focusing on superior user experience, transparent privacy policies, and responsive, developer-led support. It will achieve market leadership through a suite of unique, high-value features, including intelligent conflict resolution and historical data recovery, all designed for reliability at scale.

The primary goal of this PRD is to provide a comprehensive, enterprise-grade roadmap. As the project will be executed by a **single engineer**, this document is structured to be highly actionable, with a strong focus on prioritization, risk mitigation, and phased implementation. It is also intended to be **investor-ready**, demonstrating a clear vision, a viable business model, and a well-defined execution strategy.

## 2. Vision & Mission

*   **Vision Statement:** To empower individuals to take full control of their digital health data, breaking down barriers between platforms to create a unified and holistic view of their personal wellness journey.
*   **Mission Statement:** To build the most reliable, secure, and user-friendly health data synchronization app on the market, backed by transparent policies and exceptional customer support.

## 3. Problem Statement

*   **For the User:** "I use multiple health apps and devices, but my data is trapped in separate ecosystems. I can't see my running data from Garmin alongside my sleep data from Oura in my preferred app, Samsung Health. Manually entering data is tedious and I lose valuable insights."
*   **For the Market:** The digital health ecosystem is fragmented. While platforms like Apple Health and Google Health Connect aim to solve this, they are not universally adopted by all app developers, and their functionality can be limited. A dedicated, third-party synchronization tool is necessary to fill the gaps.

## 4. Strategic Goals & KPIs

| Strategic Goal | Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) | Target (Year 1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Achieve Product-Market Fit** | - Onboarding Completion Rate<br>- Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate<br>- App Store Rating<br>- **Feature Adoption Rate** | - >80%<br>- >15%<br>- 4.5+ Stars<br>- >30% for key features |
| **Build a Sustainable Business** | - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)<br>- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)<br>- Churn Rate | - $5,000<br>- >$5<br>- <5% |
| **Deliver Best-in-Class Reliability**| - Sync Success Rate<br>- **Average Sync Latency**<br>- **Backend API Uptime**<br>- Crash-Free User Rate | - >99%<br>- <5s<br>- >99.95%<br>- >99.5% |
| **Establish a Loyal User Base**| - DAU/MAU Ratio<br>- Support Ticket CSAT<br>- Net Promoter Score (NPS) | - >30%<br>- >90%<br>- >50 |

## 5. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements

*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Native-quality experience on both Android and iOS.
*   **Multi-App Integration:** Support data sync from a wide range of sources. Key launch partners for the MVP include Strava, Fitbit, Google Fit, and Apple Health. Other integrations (such as Garmin Connect, Oura, Polar, and Suunto) will be prioritized post-launch based on user feedback.
*   **Configurable Sync Mapping:** Users can define sync direction (source â†’ destination) for each supported data type.
*   **Automatic Background Syncing:** The app performs automatic, periodic data syncs.
*   **Historical Data Sync:** A premium feature allowing users to backfill their data history.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Reliability:** The app must ensure >99% data integrity and sync reliability. Data loss or corruption is not acceptable.
*   **Performance:** App launch time <2s. UI animations at 60fps. Background syncs must be battery-efficient and not appear on the OS's high-consumption list.
*   **Security:** All data transfer over TLS 1.2+. Sensitive tokens stored exclusively in the platform's native Keychain/Keystore. No personal health data stored on company servers.
*   **Scalability:** The backend architecture must be designed to support **1 million Daily Active Users (DAU)**. For the MVP launch, the system will be load-tested and provisioned to handle a peak load of **3,000 requests per second (RPS)**. This is a pragmatic starting point that balances cost and performance, with a clear path to scale further. The compute model for the MVP will be a **unified serverless model using AWS Lambda** for all business logic. This prioritizes developer velocity and operational simplicity. AWS Fargate will be assessed as a potential future optimization for cost-performance at extreme scale, but is out of scope for the MVP.
*   **Usability:** The app must be intuitive enough for a non-technical user to configure their first sync within 2 minutes of completing onboarding.

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

This section provides a high-level summary of key business risks. A comprehensive, detailed, and actively managed risk register for all technical, strategic, and operational risks is maintained in **`./21-risks.md`**. That document is the single source of truth for risk management.

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-01** | A third-party API changes or is deprecated, breaking a key integration. | High | High | See `./21-risks.md` for detailed mitigation plan. |
| **R-02**| The app is rejected from the app stores due to policy violations. | Medium | High | Thoroughly review and adhere to all app store guidelines. |
| **R-03**| The solo developer becomes a single point of failure (e.g., due to illness). | Low | High | See `./21-risks.md` for detailed mitigation plan. |
| **R-04**| The app fails to gain traction and attract a sufficient user base. | Medium | High | Focus on a core set of highly-requested integrations for the MVP. |


## 7. Execution Plan / Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Prototyping (4-6 weeks)**
    *   **Task 1.1 (Tech Stack):** A critical early task is to select the primary mobile framework. The analysis will compare Flutter and Kotlin Multiplatform, focusing on background processing capabilities, developer ecosystem, and suitability for scaling to millions of users.
    *   **Task 1.2:** Develop a proof-of-concept for the core data sync engine, connecting Apple Health and Google Fit via their native APIs.
    *   **Task 1.3:** Develop a proof-of-concept for a single cloud-based API (e.g., Fitbit) to validate the OAuth flow.
    *   **Task 1.4:** Create detailed UX flow diagrams and wireframes for the core user journeys.
    *   **Task 1.5 (New): Backend Architecture Design:** Design the scalable serverless backend architecture to meet the non-functional requirements for DAU and RPS.
2.  **Phase 2: MVP Development (8-12 weeks)**
    *   **Task 2.1:** Build out the full provider architecture and implement the top 5-6 integrations.
    *   **Task 2.2:** Implement the full monetization flow (trial, IAP, subscription) and test with sandbox accounts.
    *   **Task 2.3:** Implement the Historical Data Sync feature for premium users.
    *   **Task 2.4:** Develop a comprehensive automated test suite (Unit, Integration, E2E).
    *   **Task 2.5:** Set up CI/CD pipeline, analytics, and crash reporting.
3.  **Phase 3: Launch & Iteration (Ongoing)**
    *   **Task 3.1:** Execute the release management plan for a staged rollout on both app stores.
    *   **Task 3.2:** Closely monitor KPIs and user feedback channels.
    *   **Task 3.3:** Begin executing the post-launch roadmap, prioritizing new integrations based on user votes.
