# PRD: Data Export

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the detailed specification for the **Data Export** feature. This feature empowers users with true ownership of their data by allowing them to export it into standard, open file formats. This is a critical feature for building user trust and ensuring compliance with data portability regulations like GDPR.

To ensure reliability and performance, especially for large exports, this feature is built on an **asynchronous, backend-driven architecture**. This specification details the process of offloading export jobs to the backend, processing them reliably, and notifying the user when the export is ready for download.

*   **Priority:** Should-Have (S-2)
*   **Status:** Not Started

## 2. User Experience & Workflow

The user experience is designed to be simple and asynchronous.

1.  **Configuration:** The user navigates to "Settings > Export Data" to configure their export. [NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: Link to final UI/UX mockups to be added here.]
2.  **Initiation:** After tapping "Start Export," the UI updates to show a persistent status indicator: **"Your export is being prepared. We will notify you when it's ready to download."**
3.  **Wait:** The user can now safely close the app. The export is processed on the backend.
4.  **Completion Notification:** Once the export is complete, the user receives a push notification (`N-07`): **"Your data export is ready to download."**
5.  **Failure Notification:** If the export fails for an unrecoverable reason, the user receives a different push notification: **"Your data export failed. Please try again or contact support if the problem persists."**
6.  **Download:** Tapping the success notification opens the app to a screen where they can download the `.zip` file. The pre-signed download link will be valid for **1 hour**, as defined in the Core API Contracts.

## 3. Technical Architecture (Orchestrated by AWS Step Functions)

To robustly handle a potentially long-running and multi-step process, the Data Export feature will be orchestrated by a dedicated **AWS Step Functions state machine** (`DataExport`). This aligns with the architecture for Historical Syncs, promoting architectural consistency, reliability, and observability.

1.  **Initiation (API):** The mobile app calls `POST /v1/export-jobs`. The API Gateway triggers a new execution of the `DataExport` state machine, passing in the user's parameters.
2.  **State Machine Execution (Backend):** The state machine manages the entire workflow:
    *   **a. Fetch Data in Chunks:** The first step breaks the requested date range into manageable **30-day chunks**. A `Map` state processes these chunks in parallel, invoking a **Fargate task** for each to fetch data from the source API and store it temporarily in a secure S3 bucket (`s3://syncwell-prod-data-exports-temp/{jobId}/`). Using Fargate is critical for handling very large data chunks without hitting compute timeouts.
    *   **b. Consolidate & Format:** Once all data is fetched, a single, larger **Fargate task** consolidates the temporary data. It uses internal `Exporter` modules (format-specific logic within the worker codebase) to format the data into the requested file type(s).
    *   **c. Compress & Store:** The formatted files are compressed into a single `.zip` archive and uploaded to the final, secure S3 bucket (`s3://syncwell-prod-data-exports-final/`).
    *   **d. Finalize & Notify:** A final, lightweight Lambda function updates the `DataExportJob` table in DynamoDB with the `COMPLETED` status and the secure, time-limited S3 download URL. It then publishes an event to SNS to trigger the push notification to the user.

### 3.1. DynamoDB Job Table

A dedicated DynamoDB table will be used to track the status of export jobs.

| Entity | PK (Partition Key) | SK (Sort Key) | Key Attributes & Defined Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Export Job** | `USER#{userId}` | `EXPORT##{jobId}` | `ExecutionArn`, `Status`: `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `DownloadUrl` |

## 4. File Format Specifications

[NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: The specific version and schema for each file format needs to be defined. E.g., for FIT, what is the Profile Version?]

| Data Type | Supported Formats | CSV Schema Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Activities** | **FIT, TCX, GPX, CSV**| Header row included. Delimiter: comma. Encoding: UTF-8. |
| **Daily Steps**| **CSV** | `date,step_count` |
| **Weight** | **CSV** | `timestamp,weight_kg,body_fat_percentage` |
| **Sleep** | **CSV** | `start_time,end_time,duration_asleep_seconds,...` |

## 5. Export Validation Suite (QA)

To ensure the integrity of our exported files, a validation process will be implemented in the **backend's CI/CD pipeline**.

*   **Golden Files:** A "golden set" of sample `.fit`, `.tcx`, etc., files will be stored in the repository. [NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: Exact path to these files in the repo needs to be defined.]
*   **CI/CD Validation Job:** On every deployment, a job will run an official command-line tool to validate that the files generated by the backend `Exporter` modules are compliant with their respective standards. [NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: The specific tool and command must be defined (e.g., `java -jar FitCSVTool.jar -b ...`).]

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-91** | The generated export files are corrupt or non-compliant. | **Low** | **High** | The formal "Export Validation Suite" in the backend CI/CD pipeline is the primary mitigation. |
| **R-92** | An export job for a very large date range is slow or costly. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Mitigated by Design.** The Step Functions/Fargate architecture is designed for long-running, heavy jobs. Costs will be monitored via AWS Budgets. A new risk (R-94) is added to track this. |
| **R-93** | The temporary S3 bucket for downloads is misconfigured, allowing public access. | **Low** | **Critical**| All S3 bucket policies will be defined in Terraform and will be set to private by default. Download links will be pre-signed, time-limited URLs, which provide secure, temporary access. |
| **R-94** | A user frequently initiating very large exports leads to high, unexpected cloud costs. | **Low** | **Medium** | Implement cost monitoring and alerts via AWS Budgets. Consider adding a rate-limit or a "fair use" policy for the export feature if abuse is detected. |
| **R-95** | A bug in an `Exporter` module causes the exported data to be incomplete or inaccurate. | **Medium**| **High** | The "Golden Files" validation suite provides some mitigation. Additional automated checks (e.g., record counts) should be added to the Step Functions workflow. |
