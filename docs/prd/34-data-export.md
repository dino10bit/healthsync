# PRD Section 34: Data Export Feature

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the detailed specification for the **Data Export** feature. This feature empowers users with true ownership of their data by allowing them to export it into standard, open file formats (FIT, TCX, GPX, CSV).

To ensure reliability and performance, especially for large exports, this feature is built on an **asynchronous, backend-driven architecture**. This specification details the process of offloading export jobs to the backend, processing them reliably, and notifying the user when the export is ready for download.

## 2. Data Export Architecture (Orchestrated by AWS Step Functions)

To robustly handle a potentially long-running and multi-step process, the Data Export feature will be orchestrated by a dedicated **AWS Step Functions state machine**. This aligns with the architecture for Historical Syncs, promoting architectural consistency, reliability, and observability.

1.  **Initiation (Mobile):** The user selects the source, date range, and format and taps "Start Export."
2.  **Start Execution (Mobile -> Backend):** The app calls an API endpoint that triggers a new execution of the `DataExport` state machine, passing in the user's parameters.
3.  **State Machine Execution (Backend):** The state machine manages the entire workflow:
*   **a. Fetch Data in Chunks:** The first step breaks the date range into manageable chunks. A `Map` state processes these chunks in parallel, invoking a **Fargate task** for each to fetch data from the source API and store it temporarily (e.g., in S3). Using Fargate is critical for handling very large data chunks without hitting the 15-minute Lambda timeout.
    *   **b. Consolidate & Format:** Once all data is fetched, a single **Fargate task** consolidates the temporary data and uses the `Exporter` modules to format it into the requested file type(s).
    *   **c. Compress & Store:** The formatted files are compressed into a single `.zip` archive and uploaded to a secure, temporary folder in S3.
    *   **d. Finalize & Notify:** A final, lightweight Lambda function updates a DynamoDB table with the job's `COMPLETED` status and the secure, time-limited S3 download URL. It then publishes an event to the `PushNotificationEvents` SNS topic to inform the user.
4.  **Download (Mobile):** The user taps the notification (`N-07`), and the mobile app downloads the file from the S3 URL.

This approach elegantly handles the risk of timeouts for large exports, as the state machine can reliably orchestrate Fargate tasks for the heavy lifting.

## 3. User Experience & Workflow

The user experience is designed to be simple and asynchronous.

1.  **Configuration:** The user configures their export in the app.
2.  **Initiation:** After tapping "Start Export," the UI updates to show a persistent status indicator: *"Your export is being prepared. We will notify you when it's ready to download."*
3.  **Wait:** The user can now safely close the app. The export is processed on the backend.
4.  **Completion Notification:** Once the export is complete, the user receives a push notification: *"Your data export is ready to download."*
5.  **Download:** Tapping the notification opens the app to a screen where they can download the `.zip` file. The download link will be valid for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours).

## 4. File Format Specifications

| Data Type | Supported Formats | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Activities** | **FIT, TCX, GPX, CSV**| **FIT** is the primary, richest format. |
| **Daily Steps**| **CSV** | Columns: `date`, `step_count`. |
| **Weight** | **CSV** | Columns: `timestamp`, `weight_kg`, `body_fat_percentage`. |
| **Sleep** | **CSV** | Columns: `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration_asleep_seconds`, etc. |

## 5. Export Validation Suite (QA)

To ensure the integrity of our exported files, a validation process will be implemented in the **backend's CI/CD pipeline**.

*   **Golden Files:** A "golden set" of sample `.fit`, `.tcx`, etc., files will be stored in the repository.
*   **CI/CD Validation Job:** On every deployment, a job will run an official command-line tool (e.g., Garmin's `FitCSVTool.jar`) to validate that the files generated by the backend `Exporter` modules are compliant with their respective standards.

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-91** | The generated export files are corrupt or non-compliant. | **Low** | **High** | The formal "Export Validation Suite" in the backend CI/CD pipeline is the primary mitigation. |
| **R-92** | An export job for a very large date range exceeds the maximum Lambda execution time (15 mins). | **Low** | **Medium** | **Mitigated by Design.** The AWS Step Functions architecture breaks the export into multiple, smaller Lambda invocations, ensuring no single function will approach the 15-minute timeout. |
| **R-93** | The temporary S3 bucket for downloads is misconfigured, allowing public access. | **Low** | **Critical**| All S3 bucket policies will be defined in Terraform and will be set to private by default. Download links will be pre-signed, time-limited URLs, which provide secure, temporary access. |
