# PRD Section 55: User Feedback Collection (Deep Dive)

## 1. Introduction
Collecting and acting on user feedback is the most critical input to our product development lifecycle. This document provides a granular breakdown of the channels, processes, and tools for managing user feedback, ensuring a tight loop between our users and our development team.

## 1a. Beta Program Feedback Process
A dedicated process will be used for feedback collected from our external beta testers via TestFlight and the Google Play Beta Program.

-   **Channel:** Beta testers will be instructed to send all feedback to a dedicated email address: `beta-feedback@syncwell.com`. This ensures that beta feedback is clearly separated from general user feedback.
-   **Triage:** The Product Manager is responsible for personally reviewing all incoming beta feedback within **24 hours**.
-   **Prioritization:** Bugs reported by beta testers that are related to the feature currently under test are considered high priority and will be fast-tracked in Jira.
-   **Communication:** The Product Manager will reply directly to beta testers to acknowledge their feedback, ask clarifying questions, and notify them when a bug they reported has been fixed. This high-touch engagement is critical for maintaining a healthy and active beta testing community.

## 2. Feedback Channels & Processes

### 2.1. In-App Feedback Form - UI/UX Deep Dive
-   **Location:** The form will be accessible from the main 'Settings' screen under a "Send Feedback" menu item.
-   **Layout:**
    1.  **Category Picker:** A segmented control or dropdown with options: "Report a Bug," "Request a Feature," "Ask a Question," "General Comment."
    2.  **Subject Line:** A text field for a brief summary.
    3.  **Description:** A larger text area for detailed comments.
    4.  **Metadata Disclosure:** A small, non-editable text block at the bottom: "To help us diagnose issues, we will automatically include your User ID, App Version, OS, and Device Model in this report."
    5.  **Submit Button:** A prominent "Send Feedback" button.

### 2.2. Triage Process for New Feedback
1.  **Arrival:** A new submission creates a new ticket in our support tool (e.g., Zendesk).
2.  **Initial Review (Support Agent):** The on-duty support agent reviews the ticket within 4 hours.
3.  **Labeling:** The agent applies labels based on the user-selected category (`bug`, `feature-request`) and adds thematic labels (`garmin`, `ui`, `billing`).
4.  **Duplicate Check:** The agent searches to see if this is a known issue or a duplicate of a recent ticket. If so, they merge the tickets.
5.  **Escalation:**
    -   If it's a new, credible bug report, it's escalated to the engineering team by creating a linked Jira ticket.
    -   If it's a feature request, it's tagged and added to a "Feature Request" view for the Product Manager to review.

### 2.3. Bug Report Lifecycle
1.  **Submission:** User submits a bug report via the in-app form.
2.  **Triage:** Support agent creates a Jira ticket with a link back to the Zendesk conversation.
3.  **Engineering:** An engineer picks up the Jira ticket, reproduces the bug, and develops a fix.
4.  **Release:** The fix is included in the next app release.
5.  **Notification:** The Jira ticket is marked "Done," which notifies the support agent. The agent then replies to the original user: "Good news! The bug you reported has been fixed in version 1.3.1. Please update your app." This "closes the loop."

### 2.4. Feature Request Lifecycle
1.  **Submission:** User submits a feature request.
2.  **Triage:** Support agent tags the Zendesk ticket with `feature-request` and the relevant theme.
3.  **Product Review:** The Product Manager periodically reviews all tickets with the `feature-request` tag, using the volume of requests as a key input for the prioritization framework in `63-partner-integrations.md`.
4.  **Development:** If the feature is prioritized and built, the marketing team may announce it.
5.  **Notification:** The support team can do a bulk search for all users who requested the feature and send them a proactive email: "Hi Jane, a few months ago you asked for X. We're excited to let you know we just launched it!"

### 2.5. App Store Review Management Strategy
-   **Responsibility:** The on-duty support agent is responsible for monitoring App Store and Play Store reviews daily.
-   **Response Target:** Respond to all reviews (positive and negative) within 2 business days.
-   **Negative Reviews:** For negative reviews reporting a bug, the response should be empathetic and direct the user to the in-app feedback form where more details can be collected. "We're sorry you're having trouble! Could you please send us the details via Settings > Send Feedback so we can investigate this for you?"

## 3. Technical & Tooling Details

### 3.1. Automated Metadata Collection
The following key-value pairs will be automatically captured and sent with every in-app feedback submission.
```json
{
  "appVersion": "1.3.0",
  "buildNumber": "134",
  "os": "iOS",
  "osVersion": "16.5.1",
  "deviceModel": "iPhone14,5",
  "userId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "isPremium": true,
  "lastSyncStatus": "success",
  "locale": "en_US"
}
```

### 3.2. Integration with Support Tools
-   **API:** Our backend will have a service that listens for new feedback submissions.
-   **Action:** Upon receiving one, it will use the Zendesk API to create a new ticket.
-   **Mapping:** The user's email will be set as the ticket requester. The feedback content will be the first comment. The metadata will be added as a private internal note on the ticket.

## 4. Specific Campaigns

### 4.1. In-App Survey (NPS) Deep Dive
-   **Goal:** To measure the Net Promoter Score, a key indicator of user loyalty.
-   **Tool:** A modal in-app message, triggered by Firebase.
-   **Targeting:** Users who have been active for >30 days and have had >5 successful syncs.
-   **Flow:**
    1.  **Question 1:** "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend SyncWell to a friend or colleague?"
    2.  **Question 2 (if score 9-10):** "Thanks! What did you like most?" (Qualitative feedback)
    3.  **Question 2 (if score 7-8):** "Thanks! What could we do to improve?"
    4.  **Question 2 (if score 0-6):** "We're sorry to hear that. What was missing or not working for you?"
-   **Calculation:** NPS = % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6).

### 4.2. "Closing the Loop" Policy
-   **Policy:** We will always attempt to notify a user when an issue they reported has been resolved.
-   **Process:** This relies on the support agent's workflow. When an engineering ticket (Jira) linked from a support ticket (Zendesk) is closed, the support agent is notified. The agent will then re-open the Zendesk ticket and send a personalized reply to the user.
-   **Benefit:** This is one of the highest-impact actions for building customer loyalty and trust.

## 5. Quantitative Feedback Analysis
-   **Tool:** Zendesk Explore or a similar analytics tool connected to the support desk.
-   **Dashboard:** A dashboard will be created to track key support metrics:
    -   Volume of incoming feedback by channel (in-app, email, etc.).
    -   Feedback volume by category (`bug` vs. `feature-request`).
    -   Most common themes (based on tags).
-   **Review Cadence:** The Product Manager will review this dashboard weekly to stay on top of user trends.

## 6. Analysis & Calculations
### 6.1. Impact on Product Roadmap
-   **Hypothesis:** Systematically collecting and tagging feedback will allow us to make data-driven decisions about our product roadmap.
-   **Analysis:**
    -   The feedback collected will be the primary input for the "User Demand" factor in our Partner Integration Prioritization Framework (`63-partner-integrations.md`).
    -   By tagging feedback by category (e.g., `bug`, `feature-request`, `ux-issue`) and by theme (e.g., `garmin`, `onboarding`, `subscription`), we can quantify the most common pain points and opportunities.
-   **Goal:** At least **50%** of the items on the product roadmap for any given quarter should be directly traceable to user feedback collected through these channels. This ensures we are building a user-centric product.

### 6.2. Support Team Efficiency Analysis
-   **Hypothesis:** Providing an easy-to-use in-app feedback form will reduce the volume of support requests coming through more expensive channels like email. It also improves the quality of bug reports.
-   **Calculation:**
    -   *Time saved per bug report:* Automatically including device metadata (`FB-F-02`) saves an estimated **5 minutes** of back-and-forth communication per ticket compared to an email report.
    -   *Assumptions:*
        -   200 bug reports submitted via the in-app form per month.
        -   Support agent's time is valued at $25/hour.
    -   *Monthly Time Saved* = 200 reports * 5 minutes/report = 1,000 minutes = ~16.7 hours.
    -   *Monthly Cost Saving* = 16.7 hours * $25/hour = **$417.50 per month**.
-   **Conclusion:** The feature not only provides valuable product insights but also generates a measurable efficiency gain for the customer support team, allowing them to focus on more complex issues.

## 7. Out of Scope
-   A public-facing feature voting portal (V1 will manage feature requests internally).
-   Real-time chat support within the app.
