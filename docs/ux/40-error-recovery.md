# PRD Section 40: Error Recovery & Troubleshooting

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the detailed user experience (UX) specification for error recovery and troubleshooting within the SyncWell application. The goal is to design a system that not only informs the user of a problem but actively guides them to a solution. A graceful and helpful error recovery experience is a critical component of a trustworthy and user-friendly product.

While `17-error-handling.md` defines the technical architecture for error detection, this document defines the user-facing implementation. For the **solo developer**, a robust error recovery UX is a powerful support ticket deflection tool, empowering users to solve common problems on their own.

## 2. Error Recovery Philosophy

*   **Never a Dead End:** An error message should never be a dead end. Every error presented to the user must be accompanied by a clear, actionable next step.
*   **Be Specific and Clear:** Avoid generic messages like "An error occurred." Tell the user exactly what is wrong, in plain language (e.g., "Could not connect to Fitbit.").
*   **Guide, Don't Blame:** The tone should be helpful and supportive, guiding the user to a solution, not blaming them for the problem.
*   **Provide an Escape Hatch:** For complex or unexpected errors, always provide a clear and easy way to contact support.

## 3. Error Recovery Patterns

We will use a set of standardized UI patterns for presenting errors and recovery actions.

### Pattern 1: The Contextual Banner

*   **Use Case:** For non-blocking, persistent issues that affect a specific part of the app (e.g., a single disconnected integration).
*   **UI:** A banner appears at the top of the relevant screen (e.g., the main dashboard).
*   **Example:**
    *   **State:** The refresh token for Fitbit has been invalidated.
    *   **Banner Text (Yellow/Warning Color):** "Your connection to Fitbit has expired."
    *   **Action Button:** "[Reconnect]"
    *   **User Flow:** Tapping "Reconnect" initiates the OAuth flow for Fitbit. Upon success, the banner is dismissed.

### Pattern 2: The Actionable Dialog

*   **Use Case:** For blocking errors that prevent a user-initiated action from completing.
*   **UI:** A modal dialog appears, interrupting the user's flow.
*   **Example:**
    *   **State:** A user tries to trigger a manual sync, but the device is offline.
    *   **Dialog Title:** "No Internet Connection"
    *   **Dialog Body:** "SyncWell needs an internet connection to sync your data. Please check your connection and try again."
    *   **Action Buttons:** "[Settings]" (deep-links to the OS Wi-Fi/network settings), "[OK]" (dismisses the dialog).

### Pattern 3: The Full-Screen Error State

*   **Use Case:** For critical, unrecoverable errors that prevent the entire app or a major feature from working.
*   **UI:** The screen's content is replaced by a full-screen error component.
*   **Example:**
    *   **State:** The local database has been corrupted and cannot be read.
    *   **Icon:** A large "sad cloud" or similar icon.
    *   **Title:** "Something Went Wrong"
    *   **Body:** "SyncWell has encountered a critical error and can't load your data. Please try restarting the app. If the problem persists, please contact our support team."
    *   **Action Button:** "[Contact Support]" (opens the "Report a Problem" flow).

## 4. Specific Error Recovery Flows

| Error Scenario | Error Code | Pattern Used | Recovery Flow & User Communication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication Token Expired**| `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID` | Contextual Banner | "Your connection to {{appName}} has expired. [Reconnect]". Tapping takes the user to the OAuth flow. |
| **Permissions Revoked by User**| `API_PERMISSIONS_INSUFFICIENT` | Contextual Banner | "SyncWell's permissions for {{appName}} have changed. Please tap to re-authorize and grant the necessary permissions." |
| **No Network Connectivity** | `NETWORK_OFFLINE` | Actionable Dialog | "No Internet Connection. Please check your connection and try again. [Settings] [OK]" |
| **Third-Party API Outage** | `API_UNAVAILABLE (503)` | In-App Banner & Push (if persistent) | The app will retry automatically. If failures persist, a banner appears: "We're having trouble connecting to {{appName}}'s servers. We will keep trying automatically." A push may be sent if the outage is prolonged. |
| **Payment Failed** | `PAYMENT_FAILED` | Actionable Dialog | "Your payment could not be completed. Please check your payment details in the App Store / Play Store and try again." |
| **Local Database Corruption**| `DB_CORRUPTION` | Full-Screen Error | "Something Went Wrong. Please contact support." The app is effectively unusable until the user reinstalls or clears app data. |

## 5. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Mockup] Contextual Banner:** A mockup of the "Needs Re-authentication" banner on the main dashboard.
*   **[Mockup] Actionable Dialog:** A mockup of the "No Internet Connection" dialog.
*   **[Mockup] Full-Screen Error State:** A mockup of the "Something Went Wrong" screen.
*   **[Flowchart] Error Handling Decision Tree:** A flowchart that starts with "Error Occurs" and branches based on the error type, leading to the correct UI pattern being displayed.
