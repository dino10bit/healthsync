# PRD Section 60: Brand Assets & Identity Guidelines (Deep Dive)

## 1. Introduction
This document is the comprehensive guide to the SyncWell brand identity. It provides detailed specifications and examples to ensure a consistent, professional, and trustworthy brand experience across all platforms and materials. This process is owned by the **Head of Marketing**.

## 2. Logo

### 2.1. Logo Construction & Usage
-   **Primary Logo:** [Placeholder for logo image] The full SyncWell logo, including the icon and the wordmark "SyncWell".
-   **Clear Space:** A minimum clear space equivalent to the height of the "S" in the logo must be maintained on all sides.
-   **Minimum Size:** The primary logo should not be used at a width smaller than 100 pixels. Below this size, use the standalone icon.
-   **Icon:** The standalone icon should be used for the app icon and in UI contexts where the full logo is not legible.

## 3. Visual Identity

### 3.1. Color Palette & Usage Ratios
The UI should adhere to a 60/30/10 rule to ensure a clean and balanced feel.
-   **60% Neutral Light (`#F2F2F7`):** Used for screen backgrounds.
-   **30% Neutral Dark (`#1C1C1E`):** Used for primary text.
-   **10% Primary Blue (`#007AFF`):** Used for all interactive elements like buttons, links, and selected states.
-   **Accents:** Success Green and Energy Orange should be used sparingly for their specific purposes and should not be part of the main layout color scheme.

### 3.2. Typography - The Type Scale
This scale ensures visual hierarchy and consistency. (Sizes in points/dp).
| Style | Font Weight | Size | Line Height | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| H1 | Bold | 34 | 41 | Main screen titles |
| H2 | Bold | 22 | 28 | Section headers |
| H3 | Semibold | 20 | 25 | Sub-section headers |
| Body | Regular | 17 | 22 | All primary body copy |
| Caption | Regular | 12 | 16 | Small, secondary text |
| Button | Semibold | 17 | 22 | Text inside buttons |

### 3.3. Iconography Style
-   **Style:** Solid fill icons.
-   **Library:** We will use a professional, consistent icon library (e.g., SF Symbols for iOS, Material Icons for Android) to ensure platform consistency and reduce custom design work.
-   **Color:** Icons should be colored with our Primary Blue or Neutral Dark/Mid colors.

### 3.4. Illustration Style
-   **Style:** Simple, friendly, vector-based illustrations. They should use the brand's color palette.
-   **Usage:** Primarily for onboarding screens and empty states to add personality and visual interest.
-   **Source:** We will commission a set of custom illustrations from a designer.

## 4. Voice & Tone

### 4.1. Writing Style Guide
-   **Clarity:** Use simple words and short sentences. Avoid jargon.
-   **Conciseness:** Be brief and to the point.
-   **Active Voice:** Use active voice over passive voice (e.g., "Sync your data" vs. "Your data can be synced").
-   **Examples:**
    -   *Bad Error Message:* "An error of type 500 has occurred."
    -   *Good Error Message:* "Something went wrong. Please try again in a moment."
    -   *Bad CTA:* "Submit"
    -   *Good CTA:* "Save Changes"

## 5. Brand Application

### 5.1. App Store Screenshot Guidelines
-   **Layout:** Each screenshot will have a title at the top in our brand typeface, followed by a clean image of the app UI on a device mockup.
-   **Messaging:** The titles should focus on benefits, not features. (e.g., "See Your Whole Day," "Connect All Your Apps," "Sync Automatically").
-   **Content:** The screenshots will showcase the app's most visually appealing and valuable screens: the main dashboard, the list of integrations, and the configuration screen.

### 5.2. Email & Transactional Email Design
-   **Template:** All emails will use a simple HTML template with the SyncWell logo in the header.
-   **Content:** The body will use the standard brand typography and colors.
-   **CTA:** All buttons in emails will use the Primary Blue color.

### 5.3. "Brand in Action" - Mockups
-   **Purpose:** To provide a clear visual reference for how the brand system comes together.
-   **Content:** [Placeholder for 2-3 key screen mockups, e.g., the main dashboard, settings, and paywall, designed in Figma and embedded here as images].

### 5.4. Brand Asset Repository
-   **Location:** A centralized Figma project will be the single source of truth for all brand assets.
-   **Contents:**
    -   Logo files (SVG, PNG)
    -   Color palette library
    -   Typography styles
    -   Iconography library
    -   All final illustration and mockup assets.
-   **Access:** The entire team will have view access to the Figma project.

## 6. Analysis & Calculations
### 7.1. Justification for Brand Identity Choices
-   **Color Palette:**
    -   **"SyncWell Blue" (`#007AFF`):** This is a standard, trusted blue commonly used in tech (e.g., Apple, Facebook, Twitter). It evokes feelings of trust, reliability, and professionalism, which are core to our brand. Its use as a primary color for CTAs is a well-established UX pattern.
    -   **"Success Green" (`#34C759`):** A vibrant green universally associated with success and positive confirmation. This provides clear, immediate feedback to the user.
    -   **"Energy Orange" (`#FF9500`):** A warm, energetic accent color used to draw attention without the alarming connotation of red. Ideal for highlighting new features or warnings that are not critical errors.
-   **Typography:**
    -   **Native Typefaces (SF Pro, Roboto):** The decision to use native system fonts instead of a custom web font is a calculated trade-off.
        -   **Pro:** Guarantees optimal performance, legibility, and a familiar feel for the user on their specific platform. It also eliminates the need to load custom font files, reducing app size and initial load time.
        -   **Con:** Less unique brand expression compared to a custom font.
        -   **Conclusion:** For a utility app like SyncWell, performance and a native feel are more important than a unique typographic identity.

### 7.2. Asset Creation Cost Analysis
-   **Hypothesis:** A professional brand identity requires an initial investment in design services.
-   **Cost Estimation (Freelance Designer):**
    -   *Assumptions:*
        -   Engaging a freelance brand/UI designer.
        -   Project-based pricing.
    -   *Estimated Work:*
        -   Logo Design (Primary + Icon): ~$1,500
        -   App Store Screenshot Template Design: ~$1,000
        -   Social Sharing Image Templates: ~$500
    -   *Total Estimated Upfront Design Cost:* **$3,000**.
-   **Conclusion:** A budget of approximately $3,000 should be allocated for the creation of high-quality, professional brand assets. This is a crucial investment for making a good first impression on the App Stores and building a trustworthy brand image.

## 7. Out of Scope
-   A full, detailed design system with coded components (this would be a post-launch project).
-   Animated logos or complex motion graphics.
