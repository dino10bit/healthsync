# Security Incident Response Plan

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the procedure for responding to security incidents at SyncWell. The goal is to provide a clear, actionable plan to ensure a swift, effective, and coordinated response to any security threat, thereby minimizing its impact on the company and its users.

## 2. Scope
This plan applies to all SyncWell employees and covers any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of SyncWell's data or systems.

## 3. Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) Charter

### 3.1. Mission Statement
The SIRT's mission is to protect SyncWell and its users from security threats by preparing for, and rapidly responding to, security incidents, thereby minimizing impact and maintaining trust.

### 3.2. Scope and Authority
The SIRT is authorized to take all necessary actions to contain and remediate a security incident, including but not limited to:
*   Isolating or shutting down affected systems.
*   Revoking credentials.
*   Restricting access to physical or virtual resources.
*   Initiating the disaster recovery plan.

### 3.3. Team Composition & Roles
The SIRT is a virtual team composed of representatives from key departments.
*   **Core Team:**
    *   **SIRT Lead:** Head of Security (overall accountability)
    *   **Incident Commander (IC):** The on-call SRE Lead is the default IC, responsible for coordinating the response for a specific incident.
    *   **Communications Lead:** Head of Support (responsible for all user-facing communications).
    *   **Technical Lead:** The on-call Core Backend Lead (responsible for the technical investigation and remediation).
*   **Extended Team (as needed):**
    *   Legal Counsel
    *   Mobile Engineering Lead
    *   Head of Product
*   **All Employees:** All employees are responsible for immediately reporting any suspected security incident to the SIRT via the `#security-incidents` Slack channel.

## 4. Incident Response Phases
The incident response process follows the NIST framework:

### 4.1. Preparation
- Regular training for all employees on security best practices.
- Quarterly DR and incident response tabletop exercises.
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation and runbooks.

### 4.2. Detection & Analysis
- **Detection:** Incidents can be detected via automated alerts (CloudWatch, Snyk), user reports, or employee observation.
- **Reporting:** All suspected incidents must be immediately reported in the **`#security-incidents`** Slack channel.
- **Triage:** The on-call IC triages the report to determine its severity and escalates if necessary.

### 4.3. Containment, Eradication, & Recovery
- **Containment:** The first priority is to contain the incident to prevent further damage (e.g., by revoking credentials, isolating affected systems).
- **Eradication:** Once contained, the root cause of the incident is identified and removed (e.g., by patching a vulnerability).
- **Recovery:** Systems are restored to normal operation from a known-good state.

### 4.4. Post-Incident Activity
- **Post-Mortem:** A blameless post-mortem is conducted for all high-severity incidents to identify root causes and lessons learned.
- **Reporting:** The incident and its resolution are documented. For major incidents affecting users, a public report will be published on the company blog.
- **Action Items:** All action items from the post-mortem are tracked to completion in Jira.
