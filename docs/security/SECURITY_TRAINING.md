# Security Awareness Training Program

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the security awareness training program for all SyncWell employees. A strong security culture is a critical layer of our defense-in-depth strategy. The goal of this program is to ensure that all employees are aware of their security responsibilities and are equipped to identify and respond to common security threats.

## 2. Program Requirements

### 2.1. Mandatory Annual Training
*   All SyncWell employees, including full-time, part-time, and contractors, are required to complete a security awareness training course **within 30 days of their start date** and **annually thereafter**.
*   Completion of this training is a condition of continued employment.

### 2.2. Training Content
The training program will be delivered via a third-party e-learning platform (e.g., KnowBe4, SANS) and will cover, at a minimum, the following topics:
*   **Phishing and Social Engineering:** How to identify and report phishing emails and other social engineering attacks.
*   **Password Security:** Best practices for creating and managing strong, unique passwords, and the importance of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   **Data Handling:** The employee's responsibility for protecting sensitive company and user data.
*   **Acceptable Use:** The acceptable use policy for company equipment and resources.
*   **Incident Reporting:** How to report a suspected security incident.

### 2.3. Role-Specific Training
In addition to the general awareness training, employees in specific roles will be required to complete additional, more specialized training:
*   **Engineers:** Annual training on secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10), dependency management, and threat modeling.
*   **SRE/Ops Team:** Advanced training on cloud security best practices for AWS.
*   **Support Team:** Training on how to handle sensitive user data and how to identify and respond to social engineering attempts targeted at support channels.

## 3. Phishing Simulations
*   To reinforce the training and test employee awareness, the Security team will conduct **quarterly simulated phishing campaigns**.
*   These campaigns will target all employees with realistic but harmless phishing emails.
*   The results of these campaigns (e.g., click rate, report rate) will be used to measure the effectiveness of the training program and identify areas for improvement. Individual results will be kept confidential.

## 4. Program Ownership and Tracking
*   **Ownership:** The **Head of Security** is the owner of the security awareness training program.
*   **Tracking:** Completion of all required training will be tracked. The Security team will work with HR and team leads to ensure that all employees complete their training on time. Any employee who is more than 30 days overdue on their required training will have their access to company systems suspended until the training is complete.
