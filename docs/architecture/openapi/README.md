This directory contains OpenAPI specifications for the SyncWell API.

The file `07-apis-integration_stub.yaml` is a skeleton OpenAPI v3 specification that was automatically generated by analyzing the API contracts and endpoint descriptions found in the project's PRD documents, primarily `06-technical-architecture.md` and `07-apis-integration.md`. This stub is intended to be a starting point and makes several assumptions. The key assumptions are that all endpoints follow a standard RESTful pattern, that success and error responses use common HTTP status codes, and that the data models for requests and responses can be inferred from the documented examples. This stub should be reviewed and refined by the engineering team to create a complete and accurate API specification.
