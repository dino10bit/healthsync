# Appendix A: Technology Radar

> **DOCUMENT STATUS: LIVING DOCUMENT**
> This document is maintained by the Principal Engineering council and is updated on a quarterly basis.

To provide context on our technology choices and guide future evolution, we maintain a technology radar. This helps us track technologies we are adopting, exploring, or have decided to put on hold. It is a living document, expected to change as we learn and the technology landscape evolves.

The process for updating this radar is a quarterly meeting where new technologies are proposed and debated. A majority vote from the council is required to move an item between rings.

## Adopt

These are technologies we have chosen as the foundation for the SyncWell platform. They are the standard choice for their respective domains.

| Technology | Domain | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kotlin Multiplatform** | Cross-Platform Logic | Core strategy for code reuse between mobile clients. |
| **AWS Lambda & Fargate** | Backend Platform | Core of our scalable, event-driven architecture, using the appropriate compute for each workload (Lambda for Hot Path, Fargate for Cold Path). |
| **Terraform** | Infrastructure as Code | Standard for provisioning and managing our cloud infrastructure. |
| **LocalStack** | Local Development | Essential for providing a high-fidelity local development loop. |
| **Pact** | Contract Testing | Critical for ensuring API stability between the client and backend. |

## Trial

These are technologies we believe have high potential and should be actively prototyped on non-critical projects or features to evaluate their fit.

| Technology | Domain | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metabase / Superset** | Business Intelligence | To empower product and business teams with self-service analytics without engineering effort. A trial is needed to select the best fit for our needs. |
| **Docusaurus** | Documentation | As our API and developer ecosystem grows, a dedicated documentation portal will be invaluable. Docusaurus is a leading candidate to trial. |

## Assess

These are technologies that could be game-changers in the longer term. We should invest time to research and understand them, but we are not yet committed to using them.

| Technology | Domain | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MLflow** | MLOps | When we begin developing the AI Insights features, MLflow is a tool we must assess for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It is compatible with our choice of Amazon SageMaker. |

## Hold

These are technologies that we have considered but have decided not to use at this time. They may be revisited later if our architectural needs change significantly.

| Technology | Domain | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kubernetes (EKS / Self-Managed)** | Container Orchestration | We are holding on Kubernetes due to its significant operational overhead. Our serverless-first approach is a better fit for the event-driven nature of the application and aligns with our goal of minimizing infrastructure management. |
| **ScyllaDB / Cassandra** | NoSQL Database | DynamoDB meets all of our current and projected needs for metadata storage. We will not consider alternative NoSQL databases unless we hit a specific, insurmountable limitation with DynamoDB. |
| **Service Mesh (Linkerd, etc.)**| Service-to-Service | A service mesh is a solution for managing a large and complex microservices architecture. Our current architecture is too simple to justify this complexity. We will put this on hold indefinitely. |
