# Cost Model Assumptions

This document lists the key assumptions used to generate the cost models and financial projections in `./66-costs-model_summary.md`.

## I. Workload & Load Assumptions

*   **Normal Load (Baseline):** The primary model is based on a workload of **1 million Daily Active Users (DAU)**, generating approximately 7.6 million sync jobs per day (~228 million per month).
*   **Peak Load:** The "peak load" scenario is defined as a sustained rate of **3,000 requests per second (RPS)**, as per the non-functional requirements.
*   **User Tier Ratio:** At 1M DAU, it is projected that there will be 200,000 "Pro" tier users and 800,000 "Free" tier users.
*   **Webhook Traffic:** It is assumed that providers supporting webhooks account for 50% of the total event volume.

## II. Infrastructure & Pricing Assumptions

*   **Compute (Fargate):** The Fargate worker fleet is assumed to run on **90% Spot instances** and 10% On-Demand instances, using the ARM-based Graviton architecture for better price/performance.
*   **Compute (Lambda):** The Lambda cost model for the alternative analysis assumes an average invocation duration of **2,000 ms** at **512 MB** of memory.
*   **EC2 Alternative:** The EC2 cost comparison assumes a fleet of **5 `t4g.medium` instances** to match the Fargate compute capacity.
*   **Networking:** The networking analysis assumes a total of **1.6 TB of data** processed by the Fargate worker fleet's egress path per month.
*   **Pro Tier Pricing:** The break-even analysis is based on a Pro Tier subscription price of **$2.99 per month**.

## III. Algorithmic & Application Logic Assumptions

*   **Log Volume & Tiered Observability:** The model assumes that tiered log sampling (aggressively sampling `FREE` users) reduces overall CloudWatch log ingestion volume by approximately **30%**.
*   **Event Coalescing:** It is assumed that the event coalescing strategy for webhooks can achieve a **60% reduction** in the number of "chatter" events processed by the backend.
*   **Pre-flight Checks:** The model assumes that polling-based syncs account for a specific portion of the workload and that pre-flight checks eliminate **~61 million** unnecessary Fargate task invocations per month.
*   **Credential Caching:** The Just-in-Time (JIT) credential caching strategy is assumed to reduce API calls to AWS Secrets Manager by **95%**.
*   **Data Hydration:** The intelligent data hydration strategy is assumed to reduce NAT Gateway data processing charges by **~$18/month**.

## IV. Non-Production Environment Assumptions

*   **Staging Environment:** The load on the staging environment is assumed to be less than **1%** of the production load.
*   **Development Environment:** Cloud infrastructure costs for local development are assumed to be **near zero** due to the use of LocalStack. The primary cost is engineer operational expense (OpEx) for licenses.

## 2. Detailed Service-Level Cost Breakdown (Normal Load)

This section provides a detailed, bottom-up cost estimation based on the final, fully-optimized technical architecture for the "Normal Load" scenario (1M DAU, 7.6M jobs/day, ~228M jobs/month).

| Category | Service | Component & Calculation | Estimated Cost (per Month) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Compute** | AWS Fargate | 90% Spot, Graviton, Batching, Hydration | $95.17 |
| | AWS Lambda | Authorizer, Pre-flight Checks, etc. | $70.00 |
| **API & Messaging** | Amazon SQS | FIFO & Standard Queues (~421M messages total) | $206.34 |
| | Amazon EventBridge| Bus (~40M events post-coalescing & direct integration) | $40.00 |
| | API Gateway | WebSocket API for hot users | $10.00 |
| | AWS Step Functions| Scheduling state machine: ~1.5M transitions | $37.50 |
| **Database & Cache** | Amazon DynamoDB | On-demand, reduced reads from pre-flight | $103.29 |
| | Amazon ElastiCache| 2x `cache.t4g.medium` nodes for Redis | $100.80 |
| **Observability** | AWS CloudWatch | Tiered Sampling for Logs & Traces | $82.50 |
| **Networking & Security**| AWS NAT Gateway | Reduced egress from data hydration | $119.00 |
| | AWS WAF | Web ACL, rules, and 250M requests | $160.00 |
| **Data Governance** | AWS Glue Schema Registry| 100 versions + 218M requests | $31.80 |
| | AWS Secrets Manager| App secrets + cached API calls | $11.00 |
| **Data Storage** | Amazon S3 | Log & backup storage with lifecycle policies | $8.00 |
| | Amazon CloudFront | CDN for APIs & static assets | $55.00 |
| **Total** | | | **~$1,120.23** |

### 2.1. Analysis of Deep Cost Model
This detailed, bottom-up analysis reveals that the true operational cost is approximately **$1,120 per month**. This model is the result of a comprehensive, multi-layered optimization strategy that combines efficient infrastructure choices with intelligent, application-aware logic to minimize waste.

*   **Key Cost Drivers:** After extensive optimization, the remaining primary cost drivers are messaging (SQS), security (WAF), networking (NAT Gateway), and core database/cache services.
*   **Integrated Optimizations:** The cost figures in the table above are achieved through several key strategies:
    *   **API & Ingress Path:** The architecture uses **CloudFront** to cache API requests and **direct API Gateway-to-SQS integrations**, which significantly reduces costs. The CloudFront cost of **~$55.00** reflects its role serving both static assets and API traffic, which in turn reduces the load and cost on the downstream API Gateway and compute services. The EventBridge cost of **~$40.00** is significantly lower because two high-volume paths (API Gateway ingress and webhook coalescing) send messages directly to SQS, bypassing the event bus entirely.
    *   **Tiered Observability:** The CloudWatch cost of **~$82.50** is significantly reduced by implementing tiered log sampling. Log data for `FREE` users is sampled aggressively, while `PRO` users receive higher fidelity, aligning cost with revenue.
    *   **Pre-flight Checks:** The Fargate, Lambda, and DynamoDB costs are optimized via a pre-flight check for polling-based syncs. A lightweight Lambda (**~$17/month** of the total Lambda cost) checks for new data first, avoiding an estimated **61 million** unnecessary Fargate task invocations per month and their associated database reads. This accounts for the lower Fargate and DynamoDB costs.
    *   **Intelligent Data Hydration:** The NAT Gateway and Fargate costs are further reduced by fetching heavyweight data payloads only when necessary, minimizing data transfer and processing. This accounts for the **~$18/month** reduction in NAT Gateway data processing charges.
*   **Fixed vs. Variable Costs:**
    *   **Fixed:** The largest fixed costs are the hourly charges for the NAT Gateway (~$65) and the ElastiCache cluster (~$101). Total fixed costs are approximately **$200/month**.
    *   **Variable:** The remaining **~$920/month** are variable costs that scale directly with user activity.

### 2.2. Granular Analysis of Key Cost Drivers
To better understand the cost structure, this section provides a deeper look into the key cost drivers.

#### Amazon CloudWatch Costs (~$82.50/month)
The observability suite cost is heavily optimized via the **Tiered Observability** strategy.

| CloudWatch Component | Calculation | Estimated Cost (per Month) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log Ingestion** | Tiered sampling reduces volume by ~30% | $40.00 |
| **X-Ray Traces** | Dynamic sampling is in place | $12.50 |
| **Custom Metrics & Alarms**| Placeholder for various metrics and alarms | $30.00 |
| **Total** | | **~$82.50** |

#### Amazon EventBridge & SQS Costs (~$246/month)
The eventing and messaging layer is a critical part of the architecture. Costs are driven by the high volume of events flowing through the system. The following optimizations are in place:
*   The expensive EventBridge Scheduler has been replaced by a more cost-effective SQS-based delayed polling mechanism.
*   **Direct Ingress Path:** The highest-volume ingestion path from API Gateway now sends jobs directly to SQS, bypassing EventBridge. This architectural change accounts for the significant reduction in EventBridge events and costs.
*   The core `HotPathSyncQueue` uses SQS FIFO, which has a different pricing model than Standard queues.
*   Event coalescing is used on webhook events to dramatically reduce the number of events sent to EventBridge.

| Service | Component | Calculation | Estimated Cost (per Month) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EventBridge** | Custom Event Puts | ~40M events * $1.00/M | $40.00 |
| **SQS** | FIFO & Standard Queues | ~421M messages * $0.50/M (avg) | $206.34 |
| **Total** | | | **~$246.34** |

## 3. Cost Analysis: Peak Load

This section analyzes the maximum cost "burn rate" under the peak load non-functional requirement (NFR) of **3,000 requests per second (RPS)**, as specified in `06-technical-architecture.md`. This analysis is crucial for understanding the financial implications of a major traffic spike and ensuring the system's cost structure can handle such events without causing a financial incident.

The following costs are calculated on an **hourly basis**, representing the cost incurred for one hour of sustained peak load.

**Peak Load Assumptions:**
*   **Ingress:** 3,000 requests per second.
*   **Total Hourly Jobs:** 3,000 RPS * 3,600 seconds/hour = 10.8 million jobs/hour.
*   **Fargate Scaling:** The worker fleet scales up from 9 tasks to ~310 tasks to handle the load.

**Peak Load Hourly Cost Breakdown:**

| Category | Service | Component & Calculation | Estimated Cost (per Hour) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Compute** | AWS Fargate | Worker Fleet scales to ~310 tasks * $0.055/hr | $17.05 |
| **Messaging & Events** | Amazon SQS | 10.8M messages * $0.40/M | $4.32 |
| | Amazon EventBridge| Bus: ~5.4M events * $1.00/M | $5.40 |
| **Database & Cache** | Amazon DynamoDB | 10.8M writes * $1.25/M | $13.50 |
| **Observability** | AWS CloudWatch | Logs: ~53 GB ingested * $0.50/GB | $26.50 |
| **Networking & Security**| AWS NAT Gateway | Data: ~77 GB processed * $0.045/GB | $3.47 |
| | AWS WAF | 10.8M requests * $0.60/M | $6.48 |
| **Fixed Costs** | ElastiCache, NAT Gateway, etc. | Prorated hourly cost | $0.23 |
| **Total** | | | **~$76.95 per hour** |

### Analysis

Under a sustained peak load of 3,000 RPS, the estimated cost for the infrastructure is approximately **$77 per hour**. This is a significant increase from the normal operating cost of ~$1.52/hour ($1,097 / 720 hours).

*   **Primary Drivers:** During a peak event, the primary cost drivers shift to services that scale directly with request volume. **CloudWatch Log Ingestion** becomes the single largest expense, followed by **Fargate** compute and **DynamoDB** writes.
*   **Financial Implications:** While a cost of $77/hour is high, it's important to frame it within the context of a temporary spike. If such a peak were sustained for a full 24 hours, it would cost ~$1,848. This analysis confirms that the on-demand, serverless nature of the architecture allows it to handle extreme peaks in load, but highlights the importance of cost monitoring and anomaly detection to alert the team if such a peak is sustained for an unusual length of time.

## 4. Financial Projections & Scalability (Revised)

This section is revised based on the new, fully-optimized cost model of **~$1,120/month**.

### 4.1. Annual Cost Projection (1M DAU)
*   **Calculation:** $1,120/month * 12 months = **$13,440**
*   **Projected Annual Cost:** Approximately **$13,500 per year**.

### 4.2. Revised Scalability Analysis
Based on the new cost structure (Fixed: ~$200/month, Variable: ~$920/month per 1M DAU). This table projects the costs for different user load scenarios.

| Metric | 250k DAU (Projected) | 1M DAU (Baseline) | 5M DAU (Projected) | 10M DAU (Projected) | 20M DAU (Projected) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Variable Costs/Month**| ~$230 | ~$920 | ~$4,600 | ~$9,200 | ~$18,400 |
| **Fixed Costs/Month** | ~$200 | ~$200 | ~$200 | ~$200 | ~$200 |
| **Total Monthly Cost**| **~$430** | **~$1,120** | **~$4,800** | **~$9,400** | **~$18,600** |

*Note: Fixed costs are held constant for this projection. A more detailed analysis is required to model how these costs (e.g., for cache clusters) will step-scale with significantly higher user loads.*

### 4.3. Low-End Scalability Analysis (Corrected)

For a clearer view of costs during the initial growth phases of the platform, this section projects costs for lower DAU tiers. The model has been corrected to use the more precise fixed cost base of **$218.80** derived from the detailed service breakdown.

| Metric                | 100 DAU (Projected) | 1k DAU (Projected) | 10k DAU (Projected) | 50k DAU (Projected) | 100k DAU (Projected) |
| :-------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :------------------- |
| **Variable Costs/Month**| ~$0.09              | ~$0.88             | ~$8.79              | ~$43.93             | ~$87.86              |
| **Fixed Costs/Month**   | ~$218.80            | ~$218.80           | ~$218.80            | ~$218.80            | ~$218.80             |
| **Total Monthly Cost**  | **~$219**           | **~$220**          | **~$228**           | **~$263**           | **~$307**            |

## 4a. Service-Level Cost Projections for Early Growth Stages (Corrected)

This section provides a more granular, service-by-service cost breakdown for the early-stage growth phases. The calculations have been corrected to align with the revised fixed/variable cost model, ensuring consistency with the summary table above.

### Detailed Service-Level Cost Breakdown (Normal Load)

This table projects the **monthly costs** for each service under normal load at lower DAU tiers.

| Category | Service | 100 DAU (Monthly) | 1k DAU (Monthly) | 10k DAU (Monthly) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Compute** | AWS Fargate | ~$0.10 | ~$0.95 | ~$9.52 |
| | AWS Lambda | ~$0.07 | ~$0.70 | ~$7.00 |
| **API & Messaging** | Amazon SQS | ~$0.21 | ~$2.06 | ~$20.63 |
| | Amazon EventBridge| ~$0.06 | ~$0.57 | ~$5.70 |
| | API Gateway | ~$0.01 | ~$0.10 | ~$1.00 |
| | AWS Step Functions| ~$0.04 | ~$0.38 | ~$3.75 |
| **Database & Cache** | Amazon DynamoDB | ~$0.10 | ~$1.03 | ~$10.33 |
| | Amazon ElastiCache| ~$100.80 | ~$100.80 | ~$100.80 |
| **Observability** | AWS CloudWatch | ~$30.01 | ~$30.53 | ~$35.25 |
| **Networking & Security**| AWS NAT Gateway | ~$65.01 | ~$65.54 | ~$70.40 |
| | AWS WAF | ~$10.02 | ~$10.15 | ~$11.50 |
| **Data Governance** | AWS Glue Schema Registry| ~$0.03 | ~$0.32 | ~$3.18 |
| | AWS Secrets Manager| ~$0.01 | ~$0.11 | ~$1.10 |
| **Data Storage** | Amazon S3 | ~$8.00 | ~$8.00 | ~$8.00 |
| | Amazon CloudFront | ~$5.00 | ~$5.00 | ~$5.00 |
| **Total** | | **~$219.47** | **~$226.24** | **~$293.16** |

*Note: Totals may have minor rounding differences from the summary table above.*

### Detailed Service-Level Cost Breakdown (Peak Load)

This table projects the **hourly costs** for each service under a peak load scenario, which is assumed to scale linearly with DAU (0.3 RPS for 100 DAU, 3 RPS for 1k DAU, 30 RPS for 10k DAU).

| Category | Service | 100 DAU (Hourly) | 1k DAU (Hourly) | 10k DAU (Hourly) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Compute** | AWS Fargate | ~$0.00 | ~$0.02 | ~$0.17 |
| **Messaging & Events** | Amazon SQS | ~$0.00 | ~$0.00 | ~$0.04 |
| | Amazon EventBridge| ~$0.00 | ~$0.01 | ~$0.05 |
| **Database & Cache** | Amazon DynamoDB | ~$0.00 | ~$0.01 | ~$0.14 |
| **Observability** | AWS CloudWatch | ~$0.00 | ~$0.03 | ~$0.27 |
| **Networking & Security**| AWS NAT Gateway | ~$0.23 (fixed) | ~$0.23 (fixed) | ~$0.23 (fixed) |
| | AWS WAF | ~$0.00 | ~$0.01 | ~$0.06 |
| **Total** | | **~$0.23** | **~$0.31** | **~$0.96** |

## 5. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Analysis (Revised)

This analysis is updated with the new total monthly cost of ~$1,120.

*   **Blended Average Cost Per User (ACPU):** $1,120 / 1,000,000 DAU = **$0.00112 per user per month**.
*   **Tier-Specific Cost:** A Pro user now costs approximately **$0.0037 per month**, while a Free user costs **$0.00028 per month**.

## 6. Break-Even Analysis (Revised)

With the fully optimized cost base, the break-even point is calculated.

*   **Assumption:** Pro Tier Price of $2.99/month.
*   **Calculation:** `P * $2.99/month = $1,120/month`
*   **Result:** `P ≈ 375`
*   **Analysis:** The revenue from approximately **375 Pro subscribers** is required to cover the entire monthly infrastructure cost. This represents only **0.19%** of the 200,000 Pro users projected at the 1M DAU mark, indicating an extremely robust and profitable business model.

## 7. Long-Term Data Storage Costs
*(This analysis is still valid and integrated into the main table, but is kept for its detailed breakdown.)*

## 8. Sensitivity Analysis

This section explores how the total monthly cost of the platform reacts to changes in key operational variables. The "Normal Load" model of ~$1,191/month is used as the baseline. This analysis helps identify which parts of the architecture are most sensitive to changes in workload characteristics, providing insight into potential future cost risks and optimization opportunities.

The following scenarios model the impact of a significant percentage increase in a specific cost driver.

| Scenario | Key Variable Change | Cost Impact (Monthly) | New Total Monthly Cost | % Increase |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Increased Data Complexity** | +50% log data per job<br>+25% network data per job | +$311 | **~$1,502** | ~26.1% |
| **2. Decreased Compute Efficiency** | +50% Fargate compute time per job | +$178 | **~$1,369** | ~14.9% |
| **3. Increased Event-Driven Chatter**| +1 additional EventBridge event per job | +$228 | **~$1,419** | ~19.1% |

### Analysis of Findings

*   **Most Sensitive Variable:** The model is most sensitive to **Scenario 1: Increased Data Complexity**. A 50% increase in log volume per job leads to a **~26.1% increase** in total platform cost. This is because **CloudWatch Log Ingestion** is the single largest variable cost component in the architecture. Any changes that increase the verbosity of the application's logging could have a significant and direct financial impact.

*   **Event-Driven Costs:** The cost of the event-driven backbone (Scenario 3) is also highly significant. Adding just one extra event to the workflow of each job would increase the monthly bill by over $200, highlighting the need for efficient event design.

*   **Compute Efficiency:** While still important, the cost model is less sensitive to a decrease in Fargate compute efficiency (Scenario 2). A 50% increase in compute time results in a more modest **~14.9% increase** in total cost. This suggests that while optimizing the worker code for speed is beneficial, optimizing for **log and event generation** is a higher-leverage activity for cost management.

This analysis concludes that managing the "data footprint" of each job—specifically the volume of logs it generates—is the most critical factor for controlling variable costs at scale.

## 9. Architectural Alternative: EC2-Based Compute Analysis

The technical architecture specifies AWS Fargate as the compute layer for the worker fleet. This section provides a comparative analysis against a traditional EC2-based architecture to validate that choice from a cost and operational perspective.

### 9.1. EC2 Cost Model

To provide a similar level of compute capacity as the Fargate fleet (~9 vCPU, 18 GB Memory), we could provision a fleet of 5 `t4g.medium` EC2 instances (providing 10 vCPU and 20GB Memory). This model would also require an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic and manage scaling.

| EC2 Model Component | Calculation | Estimated Cost (per Month) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EC2 Instances** | 5x `t4g.medium` on-demand | ~$121.00 |
| **Application Load Balancer**| 1 ALB + LCU costs for ~88 RPS | ~$40.00 |
| **EBS Storage** | 5x 20GB gp3 volumes | ~$8.00 |
| **Total** | | **~$169.00** |

### 9.2. Comparative Analysis (Fargate vs. EC2)

At first glance, the raw infrastructure cost of the EC2 model appears to be less than half of the Fargate model.

| Metric | Fargate Compute Cost | EC2 Model Cost | Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raw Monthly Cost** | ~$140 | ~$169 | **EC2** |

However, this simple comparison is misleading as it ignores the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**. The Fargate model abstracts away immense operational complexity, which has a real, albeit indirect, cost.

*   **Management Overhead:** With EC2, the engineering team is responsible for managing the underlying operating system (patching, updates), configuring and managing the auto-scaling group, and hardening the security of each instance. This requires significant engineering time and expertise, which translates to high operational costs. Fargate eliminates all of this overhead.
*   **Developer Velocity:** The Fargate model allows developers to focus solely on building and deploying their containerized application. The EC2 model requires them to also manage the infrastructure the container runs on, slowing down development and release cycles.
*   **Security & Isolation:** Fargate provides strong security isolation at the task level by default. Achieving a similar level of isolation and security with EC2 requires significant manual configuration and constant vigilance.

**Conclusion:** For a team focused on rapid product development, the higher direct cost of AWS Fargate is easily justified by the drastically lower operational overhead and higher developer velocity. The choice of Fargate aligns with the "serverless-first" architectural principle and represents a lower Total Cost of Ownership.

## 10. Architectural Alternative: Lambda-Based Compute Analysis

While the architecture specifies AWS Fargate for the worker fleet, an alternative model using AWS Lambda for each sync job was considered during the initial design phase. This section provides a comparative cost analysis to validate the final architectural choice. A Lambda-based model would remove the need for container orchestration but would execute each of the ~228 million monthly jobs as a separate Lambda invocation.

### 10.1. Lambda Cost Model

This model assumes an average job duration and memory allocation, as the exact numbers can vary.

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   **Invocations:** 228,000,000 per month.
    *   **Average Duration:** 2,000 ms (2 seconds).
    *   **Memory Allocated:** 512 MB.

| Lambda Model Component | Calculation | Estimated Cost (per Month) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute Cost (GB-Seconds)** | 228M invocations * 2s * 0.5 GB * $0.0000166667/GB-s | ~$3,800 |
| **Request Cost** | 228M requests * $0.20/M | ~$46 |
| **Total** | | **~$3,846** |

### 10.2. Comparative Analysis (Fargate vs. Lambda)

The direct cost comparison reveals a significant difference for this specific type of high-throughput, consistently running workload.

| Metric | Fargate Compute Cost | Lambda Model Cost | Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raw Monthly Cost** | ~$140 | ~$3,846 | **Fargate** |

The Lambda-based model is projected to be **over 10 times more expensive** than the Fargate model for the worker fleet's compute costs.

**Conclusion:** The primary reason for this cost difference is the workload pattern. The SyncWell worker fleet is designed to be constantly active, processing a steady stream of jobs from the SQS queue. For such high-throughput, sustained workloads, Fargate is significantly more cost-effective. Fargate's pricing model, based on provisioned vCPU and memory per hour for a long-running task, is better suited to this pattern than Lambda's per-invocation, per-millisecond pricing. While Lambda offers superior scaling for spiky, unpredictable, or low-volume workloads, the selection of **Fargate for this core worker fleet is a critical cost optimization** that saves over $3,700 per month on compute alone.

## 11. Detailed Networking Cost Analysis

The cost breakdown in Section 2 has been updated to reflect a **Hybrid Egress Firewall Model**. This section provides a deeper analysis of that cost.

### 11.1. VPC Endpoints for Internal Traffic

A core cost-optimization strategy noted in the architecture is the use of VPC Endpoints (for S3, DynamoDB, SQS, etc.). This keeps traffic between the Fargate workers and other AWS services on the private AWS network, avoiding the much higher data processing charges of a NAT Gateway and saving thousands per month at scale.

### 11.2. Egress Traffic: Hybrid Firewall Model

The architecture now specifies a hybrid model for egress traffic to balance cost and security. The high-volume Fargate worker fleet, which communicates with a small, trusted set of partner APIs, will route its traffic through a standard, cost-effective **AWS NAT Gateway**. The more expensive **AWS Network Firewall** is reserved for future, low-volume workloads that may require more advanced security inspection.

This change has a significant impact on cost, as the primary data-generating component now uses the more economical egress path.

| Component | AWS Network Firewall (Original) | AWS NAT Gateway (New) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hourly Cost (2 AZs)** | ~$569 | ~$65 |
| **Data Processing Cost (1.6TB)** | ~$104 | ~$72 |
| **Total Monthly Cost**| **~$673** | **~$137** |

By routing the 1.6TB of Fargate traffic through the NAT Gateway, the monthly cost for this component is reduced from ~$673 to **~$137**, saving over $530 per month. The main architecture diagram (`06-technical-architecture.md`) has been updated to reflect this superior hybrid model. This is a pragmatic optimization, as the destinations for this traffic are well-known and can be secured effectively with network ACLs and security groups, making the Network Firewall's advanced features unnecessary for this specific workload.

### 10.3. Cross-AZ Data Transfer

The use of Multi-AZ deployments for DynamoDB and ElastiCache incurs data transfer charges for replication. At the current scale, these costs are minimal and are generally included in the service's primary cost. However, at extreme scales (e.g., >10M DAU), this could become a more significant line item to monitor.

## 12. Cost Projections for Non-Production Environments

This section outlines the cost projections for the non-production environments required to support the development and testing lifecycle of the SyncWell platform.

### 12.1. Staging Environment

The staging environment is a critical component for ensuring the quality and reliability of our production releases. It is designed as a scaled-down but functionally identical replica of the production environment. This allows for realistic end-to-end testing, load testing, and validation of new features before they are deployed to customers.

The primary cost driver for staging is that it must run 24/7 to be available for pre-release testing and chaos engineering experiments as outlined in the technical architecture. However, the load is expected to be minimal and sporadic, consisting only of automated tests and manual QA activities.

**Assumptions:**
*   Load is <1% of production.
*   Compute resources are scaled down to the minimum required for functionality.
*   Data volumes are minimal.

**Estimated Staging Costs:**

| Service | Component & Calculation | Estimated Cost (per Month) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS Fargate** | 1x minimum size task | ~$20 | A single, non-scaled task to run the worker. |
| **Amazon SQS / EventBridge** | Low volume of events | ~$5 | Minimal event traffic from testing. |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | On-demand, minimal RCU/WCU | ~$10 | Low, sporadic usage from tests. |
| **Amazon ElastiCache**| 1x `cache.t4g.small` node | ~$25 | Smallest possible node for caching functionality. |
| **AWS Network Firewall**| 1x endpoint (single AZ) | ~$285 | The largest fixed cost, but necessary for functional parity. |
| **Other Services** | CloudWatch, WAF, etc. | ~$55 | Scaled down usage of ancillary services. |
| **Total** | | **~$400** | |

The total estimated monthly cost for the staging environment is approximately **$400**. While significant, this is a necessary investment in platform stability.

### 12.2. Development Environment

The development environment is optimized for developer velocity and minimal cost. The primary strategy, as defined in `06-technical-architecture.md`, is the use of **LocalStack** for local development. This allows engineers to run a high-fidelity emulation of the AWS backend on their local machines, eliminating the need for a shared, cloud-based development environment.

*   **Cloud Costs:** Direct cloud costs for development are expected to be **near zero**.
*   **LocalStack Pro Licenses:** The primary cost is the licensing for LocalStack Pro, which is required for advanced features and team collaboration. This is considered an engineering operational expense (OpEx) rather than a direct infrastructure cost.
*   **CI/CD Environment:** A small, ephemeral environment is provisioned within the CI/CD pipeline to run integration tests against LocalStack, incurring minimal, transient costs.

By heavily leveraging local emulation, we can provide a powerful development experience while keeping cloud spending for development to an absolute minimum.

## 14. Implemented Cost Optimizations (August 2025)

As part of a cost optimization initiative, several changes were implemented to reduce operational expenditure. This section documents the changes and their expected impact.

### 14.1. Refactored Logging in the Authorizer Lambda

The logging mechanism within the primary AWS Lambda Authorizer (`src/authorizer/handler.js`) was refactored to align with cost optimization best practices. The key changes are:

1.  **Structured JSON Logging:** All log outputs have been converted from plain text strings to structured JSON objects. While this may slightly increase the size of individual log entries, it is a critical prerequisite for advanced log analysis, filtering, and cost-effective querying in CloudWatch Logs Insights. It directly enables Proposal #6 ("Optimize Structured Log Fields").

2.  **Dynamic Log Levels:** A `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been introduced to control the verbosity of the Lambda function's logging. By default, the log level is `INFO`. Setting this to `WARN` or `ERROR` in production can significantly reduce the volume of logs ingested by CloudWatch.

**Estimated Cost Impact:**

The direct cost savings from this change on the authorizer alone are modest but demonstrate a powerful pattern. The authorizer lambda accounts for approximately 38 million invocations per month. By setting the `LOG_LEVEL` to `WARN`, two informational log entries per invocation are suppressed.

*   **Log Volume Reduction:** ~76 million log entries per month.
*   **Estimated Data Reduction:** ~15.2 GB per month.
*   **Estimated Monthly Savings (Authorizer Only):** 15.2 GB * $0.50/GB = **~$7.60/month**.

While this specific change has a small impact, it establishes a pattern that, if applied to the high-volume Fargate workers, would lead to substantial savings and help achieve the cost reductions outlined in the proposals. This change partially implements Proposal #1 ("Aggressive Dynamic Log Levels") and Proposal #19 ("Introduce a 'Request Context' Log").

### 14.2. Analysis of DynamoDB Standard-IA

Proposal #16 suggested using the DynamoDB Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) table class for long-term, infrequently accessed data. An investigation was conducted to apply this to the `SyncWellBreakGlassIndex` table as part of this optimization effort.

*   **Finding:** The `SyncWellBreakGlassIndex` table has a Time-to-Live (TTL) of 24 hours, meaning its data is short-lived and frequently written.
*   **Analysis:** The Standard-IA table class has higher per-request costs for reads and writes compared to the Standard class. For a short-lived, write-heavy table, switching to Standard-IA would likely *increase* overall costs, as the 20% higher write cost would outweigh the negligible storage savings.
*   **Action & Recommendation:** The change was initially implemented but then **reverted** after this analysis concluded it would be detrimental to costs. Proposal #16 remains a valid and valuable recommendation, but it should be applied to a different table that fits the intended profile (long-term, infrequently accessed data), such as one containing historical job records or audit trails.

### 14.3. Algorithmic Sync Optimization via "Sync Confidence"

*   **Strategy:** This optimization introduces a "Sync Confidence" caching layer in Redis to intelligently skip redundant API calls to destination providers during the conflict resolution phase of a sync. The sync worker avoids fetching data from the destination if the user's conflict strategy makes it irrelevant (e.g., `Prioritize Source`) or if a cached counter shows the destination has been empty for many consecutive, recent syncs.
*   **Cost Impact Analysis:** This change primarily reduces Fargate compute time and, consequently, log volume. While the dollar savings are modest, it represents a "no-regret" algorithmic improvement that also reduces latency and pressure on third-party APIs.
    *   **Fargate Compute:** A destination API call can add significant latency. We estimate that skipping this call for a large percentage of polling-based syncs could reduce the compute duration for those jobs by 10-15%. This translates to an estimated **5-8% reduction** in the Fargate worker fleet's variable cost.
    *   **CloudWatch Logs:** Shorter job durations produce less log data. This would lead to a corresponding **5-8% reduction** in log ingestion costs from the worker fleet.
    *   **Estimated Monthly Savings:** **$15 - $25**.
*   **Qualitative Benefits:**
    *   **Reduced Latency:** Syncs will complete faster, improving the user experience.
    *   **Reduced Third-Party Risk:** Lowers the number of API calls made to partner services, reducing the risk of hitting rate limits.

### 14.4. Event Coalescing to Reduce Chatter

*   **Architecture:** This architectural pattern directly targets the "event-driven chatter" identified in the Sensitivity Analysis as a key cost driver. It uses an SQS FIFO queue with a delivery delay to buffer and merge multiple, rapid-fire webhook events for the same user. A `CoalescingTriggerLambda` then processes these buffered events and sends a single, consolidated message directly to the main `HotPathSyncQueue`. This bypasses EventBridge entirely for this flow.
*   **Cost Impact Analysis:** This is a high-impact optimization. The primary savings come from a significant reduction in the volume of high-cost events and messages that would have otherwise been sent to EventBridge.
    *   **EventBridge Reduction:** We assume that webhook-driven providers account for 50% of the event volume (`~114M` events/month) and that a 60% coalescing rate is achievable. By sending the coalesced messages directly to SQS, we avoid the cost of these events hitting the bus.
        *   Events Reduced: `114M * 0.60 = ~68.4M`
        *   EventBridge Savings (`$1.00/M`): `68.4 * $1.00 = **~$68.40**`
    *   **New Component Costs:** The architecture uses an SQS delay queue and a `CoalescingTriggerLambda`.
        *   SQS Messages for Coalescing: The initial `114M` webhook events are sent to the `CoalescingBufferQueue`, costing `114M * $0.40/M = ~$45.60`.
        *   Coalescing Lambda: `~45.6M` invocations of a lightweight lambda costs **~$5.00**.
        *   SQS Messages to Worker: The `~45.6M` coalesced messages are then sent to the `HotPathSyncQueue`.
    *   **Net Impact:** This change adds SQS and Lambda costs but removes a larger EventBridge cost. The cost breakdown in Section 2 already reflects this optimized architecture, resulting in a lower overall EventBridge expense. The primary benefit is a net reduction in the cost of the messaging layer and reduced architectural complexity for this flow.

### 14.5. Just-in-Time (JIT) Credential Caching

*   **Strategy:** This involves implementing a local, in-memory LRU cache within each `WorkerFargateTask` to store user credentials (OAuth tokens). Instead of fetching from AWS Secrets Manager for every new user a worker encounters, it fetches once and caches the credentials for a short period (e.g., 5 minutes).
*   **Cost Impact Analysis:** The primary benefit of this strategy is improved latency and resilience, with a secondary benefit of minor cost savings.
    *   **Secrets Manager API Calls:** The current model already assumes some level of client-side caching by the AWS SDK, with an estimated `~600,000` API calls per month, costing ~$3.00. An explicit in-memory cache is far more effective, likely reducing these calls by **~95%**.
    *   **Estimated Monthly Savings:** `$3.00 * 0.95 =` **~$2.85**.
*   **Qualitative Benefits (Primary Driver):**
    *   **Improved Latency:** Eliminates a network call for the vast majority of jobs, speeding up processing.
    *   **Increased Resilience:** Allows "warm" workers to continue processing jobs for cached users even if Secrets Manager is temporarily unavailable, making the entire system more robust.
