# PRD Section 44: Contingency & Rollback Plans

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the formal contingency and rollback plans for SyncWell. It serves as a set of "break glass in case of emergency" procedures for handling specific, high-impact disaster scenarios. While our architecture is designed for high availability, this document provides the specific, step-by-step action plans to be executed if a major risk is realized.

The purpose of this document is to enable a calm, rational, and rapid response under pressure. Having these plans documented in advance is critical for mitigating the impact of a major incident and restoring service as quickly as possible.

## 2. Contingency Plan Philosophy
*(Unchanged)*

## 3. Specific Contingency Plans

### Plan A: Full AWS Regional Outage

*   **Trigger:** Our monitoring systems (CloudWatch) detect a widespread failure of a core service (e.g., Lambda, SQS) in one of our active AWS regions. Amazon's own status page confirms a regional issue.
*   **Expected System Behavior (Automated Response):**
    1.  **Health Check Failure:** Amazon Route 53 health checks for the affected region's load balancer will begin to fail.
    2.  **Automated Failover:** After a configured number of consecutive failures, **Route 53 will automatically stop routing traffic to the unhealthy region**. All user traffic will be directed to the healthy, active region(s).
    3.  **Service Continuity:** The service will remain available to users, served entirely out of the healthy region. Due to the use of DynamoDB Global Tables and replicated secrets, the failover region has all the data it needs to function.
*   **Action Plan (Manual Steps):**
    1.  **Acknowledge & Monitor:** Acknowledge the incident and closely monitor Route 53 and CloudWatch metrics to confirm the failover was successful.
    2.  **Public Communication:** Post a message to the public status page: "We are aware of a major outage affecting one of our hosting provider's data centers. Our system has automatically rerouted traffic to a healthy region, and the service is operational. Some users may experience slightly increased latency."
    3.  **Await Recovery:** Monitor the status of the failed AWS region.
    4.  **Restore & Rebalance:** Once the affected region is fully recovered and stable, update DNS settings (if necessary) to resume routing traffic to it, restoring the full active-active posture.
*   **RTO / RPO:**
    *   **RTO:** < 5 minutes (driven by Route 53 health check and failover time).
    *   **RPO:** < 2 seconds (driven by typical DynamoDB Global Table replication lag).

### Plan B: AI Insights Service Failure

*   **Trigger:** CloudWatch alarms indicate a high error rate or timeout rate from the `AI Insights Service` (e.g., the SageMaker endpoint or the LLM API).
*   **Expected System Behavior (Automated Response):**
    1.  **Fallback Mechanism:** As specified in `05-data-sync.md`, the `Smart Conflict Resolution Engine` is designed with a **fallback mechanism**.
    2.  **Graceful Degradation:** If a call to the AI service fails, the engine will log the error, skip the AI-powered merge, and automatically fall back to the default, deterministic `Prioritize Source` strategy for the sync job.
    3.  **Core Service Unaffected:** The core data sync operation will succeed, ensuring the user's data is synced reliably, albeit without the enhanced conflict resolution. The feature gracefully degrades.
*   **Action Plan (Manual Steps):**
    1.  **Acknowledge & Investigate:** Acknowledge the CloudWatch alarm and begin investigating the root cause of the AI service failure (e.g., issue with the model, API key, etc.).
    2.  **Communicate (If Necessary):** If the outage is prolonged, a minor note can be added to the status page: "Our AI-powered features are currently experiencing issues. Core data sync functionality remains unaffected."
    3.  **Remediate & Restore:** Fix the underlying issue and deploy the fix to restore full AI functionality.

### Plan C: Critical Production Bug in a New Release
*(Largely unchanged, but references new architecture)*

*   **Trigger:** The `Crash-Free User Rate` SLO drops below 99.9% within 24 hours of a new release, or a critical data-loss bug is discovered.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  Halt the staged rollout in Google Play Console and App Store Connect.
    2.  Communicate to users.
    3.  Triage using CloudWatch Logs and X-Ray traces.
    4.  Decide whether to hotfix or roll back.
    5.  Roll back by submitting the previous stable version with a higher version number.
    6.  Conduct a blameless postmortem.

### Plan D: Major Third-Party API Outage
*(Largely unchanged)*

*   **Trigger:** API error rate for a major partner spikes, and their status page confirms an outage.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  Use a remote feature flag to temporarily disable the affected integration. The app will display a banner explaining the situation.
    2.  Post a message on the status page.
    3.  Monitor the partner's status.
    4.  Disable the feature flag to re-enable the integration once the outage is over.

### Plan E: Security Vulnerability Discovered
*(Largely unchanged)*

*   **Trigger:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  Verify the vulnerability.
    2.  If severe, use a remote feature flag to put the app into a read-only or maintenance mode.
    3.  Deploy a high-priority hotfix.
    4.  If necessary, use backend scripts to invalidate all stored OAuth tokens in Secrets Manager across all regions, forcing users to re-authenticate.
    5.  Communicate transparently with users.
    6.  Conduct a full postmortem and security audit.
