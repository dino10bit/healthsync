# PRD Section 44: Contingency & Rollback Plans

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the formal contingency and rollback plans for SyncWell. It serves as a set of "break glass in case of emergency" procedures for handling specific, high-impact disaster scenarios. While the risk register (`21-risks.md`) identifies and assesses risks, this document provides the specific, step-by-step action plans to be executed if a major risk is realized.

The purpose of this document is to enable a calm, rational, and rapid response under pressure. For the **solo developer**, having these plans documented in advance is critical for mitigating the damage of a major incident and restoring service as quickly as possible.

## 2. Contingency Plan Philosophy

*   **Plan for Failure:** We assume that at some point, critical systems will fail. We do not hope for the best; we plan for the worst.
*   **Prioritize Service Restoration:** The primary goal of any contingency plan is to restore a stable service for the majority of users as quickly as possible.
*   **Communicate Clearly:** During an incident, clear, timely, and honest communication with users is paramount to maintaining trust.
*   **Blameless Postmortem:** After any incident that requires activating one of these plans, a blameless postmortem will be conducted to understand the root cause and improve the system to prevent a recurrence.

## 3. Specific Contingency Plans

### Plan A: Critical Production Bug in a New Release

*   **Trigger:** The `Crash-Free User Rate` SLO drops below 99% within 48 hours of a new release, or a critical data-loss bug is discovered.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Halt Rollout:** Immediately halt the staged rollout in both the Google Play Console and App Store Connect to prevent more users from receiving the broken update.
    2.  **Communicate:** Post a message to the public status page/social media: "We have identified a critical issue in version X.X.X and have paused the rollout. We are working on a fix and will provide an update shortly."
    3.  **Triage:** Analyze crash logs and user reports to identify the root cause of the bug.
    4.  **Decision:**
        *   **If the fix is simple and low-risk:** Proceed with the "Hotfix Release" plan (`25-release-management.md`).
        *   **If the fix is complex or risky:** Initiate a full rollback.
    5.  **Rollback (If Necessary):**
        *   Submit the *previous, stable version* of the app as a new, higher version number (e.g., if `1.3.0` is broken, resubmit `1.2.0` as version `1.3.1`). This is the standard industry practice for "rolling back" a mobile app.
        *   Set the rollout for this new version to 100% immediately.
    6.  **Postmortem:** Conduct a postmortem to understand how the bug slipped through the QA process.

### Plan B: Major Third-Party API Outage

*   **Trigger:** The API error rate for a major partner (e.g., Fitbit) spikes, and their official status page confirms a widespread outage.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Remote Feature Flag:** Use a remote configuration tool (e.g., Firebase Remote Config) to temporarily disable the affected integration within the app. The app will fetch this configuration on launch.
    2.  **In-App Communication:** When the feature flag is enabled, the app will display a banner: "Fitbit is currently experiencing a major outage. We have temporarily paused all Fitbit syncs and will resume them automatically when their service is restored." The option to connect to Fitbit will be temporarily hidden for new users.
    3.  **Public Communication:** Post a message on the status page, linking to the partner's official status page.
    4.  **Monitor:** Continuously monitor the partner's status.
    5.  **Restore Service:** Once the outage is over, disable the feature flag via Firebase Remote Config to silently re-enable the integration for all users.

### Plan C: Security Vulnerability Discovered

*   **Trigger:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered, either internally or via an external report (e.g., a user reports being able to see another user's data, which should be impossible).
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Immediate Triage:** Verify the vulnerability immediately.
    2.  **Disable System:** If the vulnerability is severe and affects multiple users, use Firebase Remote Config to immediately disable the entire sync engine for all users, effectively putting the app into read-only maintenance mode. An in-app banner will state: "SyncWell is currently undergoing emergency maintenance. We will be back shortly."
    3.  **Patch:** Develop, test, and deploy a hotfix to patch the vulnerability with the absolute highest priority.
    4.  **Data & Credential Invalidation:** If any user data or credentials were exposed, work with the relevant third-party platforms to invalidate all stored OAuth tokens, forcing all users to log in again.
    5.  **Transparent Communication:** After the fix is deployed, communicate transparently with all users about the nature of the vulnerability, its impact, and the steps taken to resolve it.
    6.  **Full Postmortem & Security Audit:** Conduct an extensive postmortem and a follow-up security audit.

## 4. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Flowchart] Incident Triage:** A flowchart showing the decision-making process from "Critical Alert Received" to activating Plan A, B, or C.
*   **[Mockup] Maintenance Mode Banner:** A mockup of the in-app banner that would be displayed if the entire sync engine is disabled via remote config.
*   **[Template] Postmortem Report:** A template for the blameless postmortem report, with sections for Summary, Impact, Root Cause, Resolution, and Action Items.
