# High-Severity Issues for GitHub

This file lists high-priority issues identified during the repository audit. It is recommended that these be created as formal issues in the project's GitHub issue tracker.

### **Issue 1: [EPIC] Validate Concurrency Model Performance and Cost**

**Labels:** `risk`, `performance`, `epic`, `critical`

**Risk ID:** R-69

**Description:**
The current architecture relies on an AWS Fargate-based compute model, but its performance and cost at the target peak load (3,000 RPS) are unproven. This represents a critical risk to the project's technical feasibility and financial viability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is designed and executed to simulate the peak load.
- The PoC measures key performance indicators, including request latency (p99), task scaling behavior, and resource utilization.
- The cost of running the PoC is extrapolated to a full month to validate the assumptions in the cost model.
- A formal decision (Go/No-Go) is made on the Fargate-based architecture based on the PoC results.

### **Issue 2: [Security] Harden Security Against OAuth Token Leakage**

**Labels:** `risk`, `security`, `critical`

**Risk ID:** R-55

**Description:**
A vulnerability in the backend that leads to a leak of user OAuth tokens from AWS Secrets Manager would be a critical, trust-destroying event. While current practices are good, they must be rigorously audited and hardened.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Conduct a formal security audit of all code paths that access AWS Secrets Manager.
- Verify that the principle of least privilege is strictly enforced by all IAM roles.
- Implement automated alerts for any anomalous access patterns to Secrets Manager.
- Commission a third-party penetration test focused specifically on this attack vector before launch.

### **Issue 3: [Resilience] Implement Proactive Mitigation for Breaking API Changes**

**Labels:** `risk`, `resilience`, `api`, `high-priority`

**Risk ID:** R-19

**Description:**
The project is highly dependent on third-party APIs, which can and do introduce breaking changes. A reactive approach to this is insufficient.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement contract testing for the most critical provider APIs (e.g., Fitbit, Strava). The CI/CD pipeline should fail if a breaking change is detected in a provider's staging environment.
- Enhance the `DataProvider` architecture to allow for an integration to be quickly disabled via a feature flag.
- Create a public-facing status page that can be updated to inform users of issues with a specific integration.

### **Issue 4: [Architecture] Design and Implement Global Rate Limiting**

**Labels:** `risk`, `architecture`, `high-priority`

**Risk ID:** R-59

**Description:**
Exhausting a third-party API's rate limit can cause widespread sync failures. The current architecture does not have a centralized mechanism to prevent this.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Design a distributed, global rate limiting system (e.g., using ElastiCache for Redis).
- The system must enforce rate limits on a per-provider and per-user basis.
- The `DataProvider` SDK must be updated to interact with the rate limiter before making an API call.
- The system should gracefully throttle requests (e.g., by delaying SQS messages) rather than failing them when a limit is approached.
