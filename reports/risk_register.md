| Source Document | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
 `07-apis-integration.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `07-apis-integration.md` | **R-19** | An API provider makes a breaking change, disabling a key integration. | High | High | Implement contract testing and versioned `DataProviders`. Have robust monitoring to detect API errors quickly. |
 `07-apis-integration.md` | **R-20** | SyncWell is denied access to a critical API. | Low | High | Be transparent with users. Have a plan to prioritize other integrations. |
 `07-apis-integration.md` | **R-21** | The complexity of implementing and maintaining numerous providers becomes a significant engineering burden. | Medium | High | Strictly adhere to the provider architecture. Automate testing for each provider. Allocate dedicated engineering resources for maintenance. |
 `07-apis-integration.md` | **R-22** | A vulnerability in the backend leads to a leak of user OAuth tokens from Secrets Manager. | Low | Critical | Enforce strict IAM policies with the principle of least privilege. Encrypt all secrets. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. |
 `18-backup-recovery.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `18-backup-recovery.md` | **R-50** | A bug in our code corrupts user configuration data in DynamoDB. | Low | High | **Mitigated.** Use the manual DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) runbook to restore the table to a state before the corruption occurred. |
 `18-backup-recovery.md` | **R-51** | A full AWS regional outage makes the backend unavailable. | Low | Critical | **Partially Mitigated.** The RTO is < 4 hours via a manual restore process to a new region using IaC and PITR. The business has accepted this RTO for the MVP to avoid the cost and complexity of a multi-region architecture. |
 `18-backup-recovery.md` | **R-52** | User loses access to their Apple/Google account. | Medium | Medium | **Accepted Risk for MVP.** Manual account recovery is not supported for the MVP due to the high security risk. See Section 6 for details. |
 `34-data-export.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `34-data-export.md` | **R-91** | The generated export files are corrupt or non-compliant. | **Low** | **High** | The formal "Export Validation Suite" in the backend CI/CD pipeline is the primary mitigation. |
 `34-data-export.md` | **R-92** | An export job for a very large date range exceeds the maximum Lambda execution time (15 mins). | **Low** | **Medium** | **Mitigated by Design.** The AWS Step Functions architecture breaks the export into multiple, smaller Lambda invocations, ensuring no single function will approach the 15-minute timeout. |
 `34-data-export.md` | **R-93** | The temporary S3 bucket for downloads is misconfigured, allowing public access. | **Low** | **Critical**| All S3 bucket policies will be defined in Terraform and will be set to private by default. Download links will be pre-signed, time-limited URLs, which provide secure, temporary access. |
 `12-trial-subscription.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `12-trial-subscription.md` | **R-34** | Users are confused about why the app has stopped working after 7 days. | Medium | Medium | The in-app banner during the trial and the clear paywall upon expiration are the primary mitigations. |
 `12-trial-subscription.md` | **R-35** | A bug in the trial state tracking allows users to extend their trial indefinitely. | **Low** | **High** | Using a third-party service like RevenueCat as the source of truth for entitlements almost completely mitigates this risk, as the state is managed on their servers, not just the client. |
 `12-trial-subscription.md` | **R-36** | The paywall is not persuasive enough, leading to a low conversion rate. | Medium | High | The A/B testing strategy defined in Section 5 is the primary mitigation. Continuously iterate on the design and copy based on data. |
 `13-roadmap.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `13-roadmap.md` | **R-37** | The solo developer experiences burnout. | Medium | High | The quarterly themes and time allocation strategy are designed to create focus and a sustainable pace. It's crucial to stick to the plan and not get distracted by non-priority items. |
 `13-roadmap.md` | **R-38** | A new competitor emerges with a significantly better product. | Medium | Medium | Stay focused on the differentiation strategy. Use the quarterly planning cycle to adapt the roadmap in response to significant market shifts. |
 `13-roadmap.md` | **R-39** | The technical architecture does not scale well. | Low | High | The 25% allocation for maintenance and tech debt is the primary mitigation. This ensures that the foundation is continuously being strengthened. |

 `21-risks.md` | R-62 | **Architecture** | A "cache stampede" event (e.g., after a deployment) causes a sudden, massive load on DynamoDB, leading to throttling and failures. | **Low** | **High** | **Medium** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-63 | **Architecture** | Cross-region data replication lag for DynamoDB or Secrets Manager exceeds the RPO, leading to data inconsistencies during a failover. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-64 | **Architecture** | A sudden, massive influx of sync requests (e.g., due to a viral event) or a temporary downstream service outage overwhelms the worker fleet, causing processing delays. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-37 | **Human Resources** | The solo developer experiences burnout, leading to a significant project slowdown. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-14 | **Technical/OS** | Changes in platform background execution policies break automatic syncing. | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-04 | **Market** | The product fails to gain traction and attract a sufficient user base to be viable. | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-61 | **Product/UX** | The addition of numerous power-user features leads to a complex UI that alienates the core, less-technical user persona. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-65 | **Human Resources** | The solo developer is a single point of failure for on-call incident response, creating a significant operational risk. | **High** | **High** | **High** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-66 | **Strategic** | The deep integration with AWS-specific managed services creates a high degree of vendor lock-in, making a future migration to another cloud provider difficult and expensive. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-67 | **Architecture** | The use of AWS Fargate introduces operational overhead for building, publishing, and monitoring container images, which is more complex than the serverless Lambda deployment model. | **Medium** | **Low** | **Low** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-68 | **Architecture** | A single "viral user" generates extremely high traffic, causing their own requests to be throttled by DynamoDB due to a hot partition. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-69 | **Architecture** | **[RISK-CRITICAL-01]** The cost and technical feasibility of the Fargate-based compute model at peak load (3,000 RPS) are unproven. | **Medium** | **Critical** | **Critical** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-70 | **External Dependency** | **(DEFERRED)** The potential Garmin integration relies on an unofficial API. This risk was deemed too high for the MVP and the integration has been deferred. | **N/A** | **N/A** | **N/A** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-71 | **External Dependency** | **[RISK-HIGH-03]** The use of Firebase Authentication creates a hard dependency on a non-AWS service for a critical function (user login). | **Low** | **High** | **High** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-72 | **External Dependency** | Third-party webhook notifications are not guaranteed to be delivered, or may be significantly delayed, leading to stale data for users on the push-based model. | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-73 | **Architecture** | The adaptive polling algorithm is complex and may be difficult to tune correctly, leading to either inefficient polling (high cost) or syncs that are too infrequent (poor UX). | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-74 | **Architecture** | **[R-001]** A failure to access critical configuration (e.g., DynamoDB table name) from AWS AppConfig at application startup could prevent the service from running. | **Low** | **High** | **High** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-75 | **Security** | **[R-002]** A compromised and revoked JWT public key could be considered valid by the Authorizer Lambda for up to 1 hour due to caching. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
 `21-risks.md` | R-76 | **Architecture** | **[R-003]** During a rate-limit backoff, the SQS `ChangeMessageVisibility` API call could fail repeatedly, potentially causing a job to be lost if not handled correctly. | **Low** | **Medium** | **Low** |
 `01-context-vision.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `01-context-vision.md` | **R-01** | A third-party API changes or is deprecated, breaking a key integration. | High | High | See `./21-risks.md` for detailed mitigation plan. |
 `01-context-vision.md` | **R-02**| The app is rejected from the app stores due to policy violations. | Medium | High | Thoroughly review and adhere to all app store guidelines. |
 `01-context-vision.md` | **R-03**| The solo developer becomes a single point of failure (e.g., due to illness). | Low | High | See `./21-risks.md` for detailed mitigation plan. |
 `01-context-vision.md` | **R-04**| The app fails to gain traction and attract a sufficient user base. | Medium | High | Focus on a core set of highly-requested integrations for the MVP. |
 `08-ux-onboarding.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `08-ux-onboarding.md` | **R-22** | The onboarding flow is confusing or too long, causing a high drop-off rate at a specific step. | Medium | High | Use analytics to track the funnel conversion rate for each step. If a large drop-off is detected at Step 5, for example, it indicates a problem with that specific screen that needs to be addressed via UI/UX changes. |
 `08-ux-onboarding.md` | **R-24** | The value proposition of the **Pro tier** is not clearly communicated, leading to a low free-to-pro conversion rate. | High | High | A/B test the contextual upsell prompts and the "Pro" feature badging to see what messaging is most effective at driving upgrades. The success of the business depends on this. |
 `09-ux-configuration.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `09-ux-configuration.md` | **R-25** | The configuration UI is too complex, leading to user frustration and abandonment. | Medium | High | The step-by-step configuration flow is designed to mitigate this by simplifying the decision-making process. Usability testing with the clickable prototype is key. |
 `09-ux-configuration.md` | **R-26** | Users misunderstand the configuration options and set up their syncs incorrectly. | Medium | Medium | Use clear, unambiguous language. The visual cue of graying out invalid options with an explanation is a critical part of preventing user error. |
 `09-ux-configuration.md` | **R-27** | The app fails to properly save or reflect the user's configuration changes. | Low | High | Implement a robust state management solution (e.g., Redux) to ensure that the UI is always a direct reflection of the app's state. |
 `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` | **R-103** | The developer skips creating the flow diagrams to save time, leading to a poorly thought-out UX and significant rework. | **Medium** | **High** | The creation of a UX flow diagram and a clickable prototype will be part of the "Definition of Ready" for any major new feature epic. Development cannot start until these exist. |
 `38-ux-flow-diagrams.md` | **R-104** | The implemented app deviates significantly from the agreed-upon flow diagrams. | **Low** | **Medium** | The clickable prototype serves as the "visual specification" for the developer. Any proposed deviations should be discussed and reflected in an updated prototype before implementation. |
 `36-user-privacy-settings.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `36-user-privacy-settings.md` | **R-97** | A bug in the de-authorization flow fails to properly delete the OAuth token. | **Low** | **High** | This must be a primary focus of the QA process. The test plan must include verifying, after de-authorization, that the token is gone from the secure storage and that subsequent API calls fail. |
 `36-user-privacy-settings.md` | **R-106**| A user accidentally taps "Delete All My Data" and loses their complex configuration. | **Medium** | **Medium** | The use of a multi-step confirmation dialog with a scary warning ("This action is irreversible and will permanently delete all your sync configurations.") is the primary mitigation. |
 `36-user-privacy-settings.md` | **R-99** | The "opt-out of analytics" toggle does not fully disable all tracking. | **Low** | **Critical**| This must be verified during the pre-launch compliance audit. The test plan will include using a network proxy to confirm that no analytics events are sent when the switch is off. |
 `29-notifications-alerts.md` | Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
 `29-notifications-alerts.md` | **R-79** | Users find the notifications annoying ("notification fatigue") and disable them globally. | Medium | High | The granular settings are the key mitigation. We will also be extremely conservative with "News & Updates" messages, sending them no more than once a month. "Sync Success" is off by default because it provides low value for high noise. |
 `29-notifications-alerts.md` | **R-80** | A bug causes notifications to be sent repeatedly or at the wrong time. | Low | High | The `Notification Dispatcher` function will implement rate-limiting using the main **ElastiCache for Redis** cluster. Before sending a notification, it will check a key like `notif-rate-limit##{userId}##{notificationType}`. If a notification of the same type has been sent recently (e.g., within the last hour), the new notification will be suppressed. This prevents notification storms. |
 `29-notifications-alerts.md` | **R-81** | Deep links from notifications are broken or lead to the wrong screen. | Medium | Medium | A centralized navigation and deep linking service must be implemented. A test plan must include manually tapping every type of notification to verify its destination. |
