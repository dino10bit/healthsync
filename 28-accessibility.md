# PRD Section 28: Accessibility (a11y)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the comprehensive accessibility strategy for the SyncWell application. Our goal is to create an inclusive product that is usable by people with a wide range of abilities, including those with visual, motor, auditory, or cognitive disabilities. Accessibility is a foundational component of product quality, and our objective is to meet and exceed the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA** standard.

For the **solo developer**, this document provides a structured, proactive plan for integrating accessibility into every stage of the development lifecycle. Building an accessible product from the start is more efficient, leads to a higher-quality codebase, and results in a better user experience for everyone.

## 2. Accessibility as a Core Tenet

Accessibility is not a feature to be added later; it is a core principle of our engineering culture.
*   **It's a Legal & Ethical Imperative:** In many regions, digital accessibility is a legal requirement. Ethically, it's the right thing to do.
*   **It Improves Usability for All:** Features designed for accessibility, such as clear layouts, good color contrast, and descriptive labels, improve the user experience for all users in all situations (e.g., using the app in bright sunlight or with one hand).
*   **It Enforces Good Code Quality:** Writing accessible code requires well-structured, semantic UI components, which leads to a more maintainable and testable codebase.

## 3. Accessibility Personas

To guide our testing and development, we will consider the needs of the following accessibility personas:

*   **Deepa (Non-sighted):** Deepa uses the VoiceOver screen reader on her iPhone to navigate all applications. She relies on clear, descriptive labels for all buttons and icons, and a logical focus order to understand the app's layout.
*   **Carlos (Motor Impairment):** Carlos has hand tremors, which can make it difficult to accurately tap small UI elements. He benefits from large touch targets and clear visual feedback for all interactions.
*   **Maria (Low Vision):** Maria uses the OS-level font scaling to increase the text size on her device. She needs the app's layout to reflow correctly without truncating text and requires strong color contrast to read content easily.

## 4. The Accessibility Checklist (Part of Definition of Done)

For any user story that involves UI changes, the following checklist must be completed.

### Perceivable
*   [ ] **Labels:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have a clear, descriptive accessibility label.
    *   *Example from **US-02**: Each app logo in the connection grid must be labeled with the app's name, e.g., "Fitbit".*
*   [ ] **Images:** All informative images have a text alternative (alt text). Decorative images are hidden from screen readers.
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** All text meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background.
    *   *Example from **US-07**: The red/orange color used for an error state on a Sync Card must still have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the text inside it.*
*   [ ] **Resizable Text:** The UI layout does not break when the system font size is increased to 200%.

### Operable
*   [ ] **Touch Targets:** All touch targets are at least 44x44px.
    *   *Example from **US-02**: The tappable area for each app logo in the grid must meet this minimum size.*
*   [ ] **Focus Order:** The navigation order for screen readers is logical and follows the visual flow of the screen.
    *   *Example from **US-01**: In the onboarding carousel, the focus should move from the main text, to the page indicators, to the navigation buttons.*
*   [ ] **No Keyboard Traps:** It is possible to navigate to and from all interactive elements using keyboard/switch controls.
*   [ ] **Custom Gestures:** Gestures like pull-to-refresh (**US-06**) must have an alternative, such as a button in a menu, for users who cannot perform the gesture.

### Understandable
*   [ ] **Clear Language:** The purpose of each screen and control is clear and easy to understand.
*   [ ] **Consistent Navigation:** The app's navigation and key UI elements are used consistently across all screens.
*   [ ] **Error States:** All error messages are clear, and the focus is moved to the element with the error. Screen readers must announce the error.
    *   *Example from **US-02**: When an OAuth login fails, the "Authorization failed" message must be announced to the user.*
*   [ ] **Complex Views:** For complex screens, ensure the information architecture is logical for screen reader users.
    *   *Example from **US-15**: The side-by-side conflict resolution screen must be structured so a user can easily compare the two activities and navigate to the resolution buttons.*

### Robust
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Test:** The feature has been manually tested with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android).
*   [ ] **Automated Scan:** The new screen passes an automated accessibility scan with no critical errors.

## 5. Automated Accessibility Testing

To catch issues early, accessibility checks will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Tooling:** A library like `axe-core` for React Native will be used.
*   **Process:** A dedicated test script will run during the `npm run test` phase of the CI/CD pipeline. This script will render each major screen of the application and run the Axe scanner on it.
*   **Failure Condition:** If the scanner detects any new, critical violations (e.g., a button without a label, insufficient color contrast), the pull request check will fail, blocking the merge until the issue is fixed.

## 6. Accessibility Statement

A public-facing Accessibility Statement will be created and linked from the app's settings and website. This statement will include:
*   Our commitment to accessibility and the target standard (WCAG 2.1 AA).
*   A summary of the accessibility features implemented in the app.
*   Known limitations or areas where we are still working to improve.
*   A dedicated email address (`accessibility@syncwell-app.com`) for users to report accessibility issues or provide feedback.

## 7. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Checklist] The Accessibility DoD:** A detailed, printable version of the checklist in Section 4.
*   **[Screenshot] Automated A11y Test Failure:** A screenshot of a failing GitHub pull request due to an automated accessibility check, showing the specific error reported by the Axe library.
*   **[Mockup] Accessibility Statement:** A wireframe of the in-app screen displaying the Accessibility Statement.
*   **[Personas] Accessibility Persona Cards:** Visual cards for Deepa, Carlos, and Maria, summarizing their needs and goals.
