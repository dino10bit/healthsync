# PRD Section 24: Help Center, Support & Feedback

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the comprehensive operational plan for SyncWell's user support systems. It establishes a multi-tiered strategy designed to empower users, provide efficient and empathetic assistance when needed, and systematically channel user feedback into the product development lifecycle.

For the **solo developer**, this document is a blueprint for building a scalable and sustainable support system. It details the philosophy, tools, and automated workflows necessary to manage user communications effectively without being overwhelmed, turning support from a simple cost center into a powerful engine for product insight and user retention.

## 2. Support Philosophy

*   **Empower First, Then Assist:** Our primary goal is to empower users to solve their own problems through a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate self-service portal (Tier 0). Direct assistance (Tier 1) is reserved for issues that cannot be self-resolved.
*   **Support as a Product Insight Engine:** Every support ticket is an opportunity. We will not just solve the user's immediate problem; we will analyze the root cause and feed that insight back into the development process to prevent the problem from recurring for other users.

## 3. Tiered Support Model

### Tier 0: Self-Service (The First Line of Defense)

*   **Channel 1: In-App Help Center:** A searchable database of articles, tutorials, and troubleshooting guides.
    *   **Content Strategy:**
        *   **Troubleshooting Guides:** Step-by-step solutions for common errors (e.g., "How to Fix a Failing Sync").
        *   **How-To Guides:** Walkthroughs for key features (e.g., "How to Configure Historical Sync").
        *   **Conceptual Explainers:** Articles explaining *why* something works the way it does (e.g., "Understanding Garmin's API Limitations").
    *   **Process:** New articles will be prioritized based on the frequency of related support tickets. All articles will be reviewed quarterly for accuracy.
*   **Channel 2: Public Feedback Portal (Canny.io):** Serves as a community forum where users can see that others may be having the same issue or have the same idea, reducing duplicate tickets.

### Tier 1: Direct Assistance

*   **Channel: Email & In-App Form:** All direct support requests are funneled into a single help desk system (**Freshdesk** is the recommended tool for its automation features and generous free tier).
*   **Service Level Objective (SLO):** First response to all new tickets within **24 business hours**.
*   **Voice and Tone Guide:** All written communication will be:
    *   **Empathetic:** Acknowledge the user's frustration first. ("I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with...")
    *   **Clear & Concise:** Use simple language. Avoid technical jargon. Use bullet points and bold text to make instructions easy to follow.
    *   **Technical & Credible:** As the developer, provide accurate, direct answers.

## 4. Help Desk Automation Workflow (Freshdesk)

To manage ticket volume efficiently, the following automation rules will be configured:

1.  **Ticket Creation:** When a ticket is created via the "Report a Problem" form, the attached metadata (app version, OS version) will be automatically added as ticket properties.
2.  **Keyword-Based Tagging:** Tickets will be automatically tagged based on keywords in the subject or body (e.g., "Fitbit" -> `fitbit` tag, "payment" -> `billing` tag).
3.  **Auto-Responder with Suggested Articles:** An auto-reply will be sent immediately, confirming receipt of the ticket. This email will also use the ticket's tags to suggest 1-2 relevant Help Center articles that might solve the user's problem before the developer even sees the ticket.
4.  **Canned Responses:** A library of pre-written responses for the top 10-15 most common issues will be created to allow for rapid, consistent replies.

## 5. The "Report a Problem" Flow

This is the most critical workflow for efficient debugging.

1.  User navigates to `Help Center > Report another problem`.
2.  A form is displayed asking for a subject and description. The user's email, app version, and OS version are pulled automatically.
3.  A checkbox, **ticked by default**, states: "Attach anonymous debugging information to help us solve your problem faster."
4.  When submitted, the Freshdesk API is called to create a ticket with all the metadata and the sanitized, PII-free JSON log file attached.
5.  The user receives the automated email response with suggested articles.

## 6. KPIs / Success Metrics

*   **Ticket Deflection Rate:** `(Number of Help Center article views) / (Number of tickets created)`. A primary measure of self-service success.
*   **First Contact Resolution Rate:** % of tickets resolved in a single developer reply. Goal: >70%.
*   **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** Measured via a one-click survey in the ticket resolution email. Goal: >90%.
*   **Tickets per 1,000 DAU:** A measure of support scalability. Goal is to keep this stable or decreasing over time.

## 7. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Flowchart] Support Ticket Lifecycle:** A detailed flowchart showing a ticket's journey from submission, through the automation rules, to developer response and final resolution.
*   **[Mockup] Help Desk Dashboard:** A mockup of the Freshdesk dashboard showing the ticket queue, tags, and key metrics.
*   **[Table] Content Plan for Help Center:** A table listing the top 15 planned articles for the Help Center at launch.
*   **[Diagram] Tiered Support Model:** A diagram visually representing Tier 0 and Tier 1 support channels and the flow of users between them.
