# PRD Section 33: Third-Party Integration Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the strategic framework for the lifecycle of third-party integrations within SyncWell. As integrations are our core product feature, a disciplined and strategic approach to selecting, developing, and maintaining them is critical for long-term success. This document formalizes that process.

The framework is designed to be data-driven and objective, using a quantitative scorecard to prioritize opportunities. For the **solo developer**, this process provides a crucial defense against misallocating precious development time. For **investors**, it demonstrates a mature, strategic approach to product expansion and partner management.

## 2. The Integration Opportunity Scorecard

The decision to pursue a new integration will be based on the outcome of this scorecard. Each potential integration is scored, and opportunities are ranked.

| Category (Weight) | Criteria | Scoring (0-5) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Demand (50%)** | Votes on the public feedback portal. | 0 = <10 votes<br>5 = >500 votes | The most important factor. We build what users ask for. |
| **Strategic Value (30%)**| Opens a new, valuable user segment (e.g., Oura for bio-hackers). | 0 = No new segment<br>5 = High-value, untapped segment | Does this expand our market or just serve existing users? |
| **Strategic Value (30%)**| Achieves parity with a key competitor. | 0 = No parity gain<br>5 = Fills a major competitive gap | Is this a "must-have" to compete effectively? |
| **Technical Feasibility (20%)**| Quality and stability of the partner's API. | 0 = Unstable, undocumented<br>5 = Well-documented, stable, modern REST/GraphQL API | A subjective assessment of the development risk. |
| **Technical Feasibility (20%)**| Ease of API access and approval. | 0 = Lengthy, manual approval<br>5 = Instant self-service access | Time-to-market consideration. |

*A weighted final score is calculated, and opportunities are ranked on the backlog.*

## 3. The Gated Integration Lifecycle

Each integration proceeds through a formal, gated lifecycle. An integration cannot move to the next stage until the "gate review" for the current stage is passed.

### Stage 1: Evaluation
*   **Activities:** A new integration is identified. The developer completes the Opportunity Scorecard. A preliminary investigation of the API documentation is performed.
*   **Gate Review:** Is the final score above the minimum threshold? Is the strategic value clear?
*   **Outcome:** "Go/No-Go" decision.

### Stage 2: Pre-Development
*   **Activities:** Apply for production API access from the partner. Create a project in their developer portal. Add the integration to the internal `32-platform-limitations.md` document.
*   **Gate Review:** Have we received production-level API keys?
*   **Outcome:** Integration is approved for active development and added to a future sprint.

### Stage 3: Development & Testing
*   **Activities:** The `DataProvider` module is built, including authentication, data mappers, and a full suite of automated tests.
*   **Gate Review:** Does the new provider pass all shared interface tests and its own specific unit tests? Is the code peer-reviewed (or self-reviewed against a checklist)?
*   **Outcome:** Ready for beta testing.

### Stage 4: Beta & Release
*   **Activities:** The integration is deployed to the public beta channel for at least two weeks. Feedback is collected.
*   **Gate Review:** Are there any blocking bugs reported by beta testers?
*   **Outcome:** Ready for public release in the next "Release Train."

### Stage 5: Maintenance & Monitoring
*   **Activities:** The integration is now live. Its error rates and performance are monitored via Firebase. User-reported bugs are addressed.

## 4. Partner Relationship Management

*   **Centralized Record:** A private repository or document will be maintained with key information for each partner, including links to their developer portal, developer support contact information, and a summary of their API terms.
*   **Proactive Monitoring:** The developer will subscribe to the developer blog/newsletter for each key partner to stay informed about upcoming API changes or deprecations.
*   **Professional Conduct:** All communication with partner developer support will be professional and courteous.

## 5. Deprecation Plan

If an API provider discontinues their service or we decide to end an integration, a user-centric off-boarding process will be followed:
1.  **3-Month Notice:** Announce the planned deprecation via an in-app banner to affected users.
2.  **2-Month Notice:** Prevent new users from connecting to the service.
3.  **1-Month Notice:** Send a final push notification reminder to active users of the integration.
4.  **Deprecation Day:** Remove the integration from the UI. The `DataProvider` code is archived.

## 6. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Table] Opportunity Scorecard:** A sample scorecard filled out for a hypothetical "Whoop" integration.
*   **[Diagram] Gated Lifecycle Flowchart:** A flowchart showing the 5 stages of the lifecycle and the formal "Gate Reviews" between each stage.
*   **[Kanban Board] Integration Pipeline:** A mockup of a Kanban board (e.g., in Trello or Jira) with columns for each stage of the lifecycle, showing different integrations as cards moving through the process.
