# PRD Section 29: Push Notifications & Alerts

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides the detailed functional and technical specification for SyncWell's notification system. This system includes push notifications, in-app alerts, and banners. The guiding philosophy is that **notifications are a feature, not an interruption**. Every alert must provide clear, timely, and actionable value to the user. A well-executed notification strategy can significantly improve user engagement and trust, while a poor one is a primary driver of uninstalls.

This specification details the notification catalog, the user-facing controls, and the underlying technical architecture required to build a best-in-class notification experience.

## 2. Notification Philosophy

Every notification sent from SyncWell must adhere to three principles:
1.  **Timely:** The information is relevant to the user *right now*.
2.  **Personal:** The content is specific to the user's own data or configuration. Broadcast marketing messages will be used extremely sparingly.
3.  **Actionable:** The notification provides a clear next step, and tapping it takes the user directly to the relevant screen in the app.

## 3. Notification Technical Architecture

*   **Client-Side:** A centralized `NotificationService` will be responsible for:
    *   Requesting user permission for push notifications.
    *   Receiving and handling incoming push notifications from the system.
    *   Handling deep link navigation when a notification is tapped.
    *   Scheduling and canceling local notifications (e.g., for trial expiration).
*   **Server-Side (Firebase Cloud Functions):** A set of serverless functions will be responsible for triggering event-driven, remote notifications.
    *   `onSyncError`: A function that can be called by the app when a sync fails permanently. It will be responsible for sending the "Sync Error" push notification.
    *   `onNewFeatureAnnouncement`: A manually triggered function used by the developer to send a broadcast message to all users about a major new feature.

## 4. Detailed Notification Catalog

| ID | Name | Type | Trigger | Default | Content (Title / Body) | Deep Link | User Control Setting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **N-01**| Sync Error | Push | A sync job fails all its retry attempts. | On | **Sync Error** / Could not sync {{dataType}} from {{source}}. Please tap to fix. | The specific sync configuration screen that has the error. | Sync Alerts |
| **N-02**| Trial Ending | Push | Scheduled locally to fire 24 hours before trial ends. | On | **Trial Ending Soon** / Your SyncWell free trial ends tomorrow. Don't lose your syncs! | The Paywall screen. | App Reminders |
| **N-03**| New Feature | Push | Manually triggered by developer via backend. | On | **New Integration!** / SyncWell now supports {{newPlatform}}! Tap to connect. | The "Connected Apps" screen. | News & Updates |
| **N-04**| Sync Success| Push | A background sync completes successfully. | **Off**| **Sync Complete** / Your {{dataType}} data was successfully synced. | The app's main dashboard. | Sync Alerts |
| **A-01**| Needs Re-auth| In-App Banner | App launch detects an invalid refresh token for a connected app. | N/A | "Your connection to {{appName}} has expired. Tap here to sign in again." | The "Connected Apps" screen. | N/A |
| **A-02**| Offline | In-App Banner | App launch or foreground detects no network connectivity. | N/A | "You are currently offline. Syncing is paused." | N/A | N/A |

## 5. User-Facing Notification Settings

The "Notification Settings" screen within the app will provide users with granular control.

### Settings UI

*   **Sync Alerts** (Toggle Switch, On by default)
    *   *Description:* "Receive alerts about the status of your syncs, such as critical errors."
    *   *Controls:* N-01, N-04
*   **App Reminders** (Toggle Switch, On by default)
    *   *Description:* "Get helpful reminders about your account, like when your trial is ending."
    *   *Controls:* N-02
*   **News & Updates** (Toggle Switch, On by default)
    *   *Description:* "Be the first to know about major new features and integrations."
    *   *Controls:* N-03
*   **Android Notification Channels:** On Android, each of these categories will be mapped to a separate Notification Channel, allowing users to further customize the sound and vibration for each type in the OS settings.

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

(This section remains largely the same but is included for completeness.)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-79** | Users find the notifications annoying ("notification fatigue") and disable them globally. | Medium | High | The granular settings are the key mitigation. We will also be extremely conservative with "News & Updates" messages, sending them no more than once a month. "Sync Success" is off by default because it provides low value for high noise. |
| **R-80** | A bug causes notifications to be sent repeatedly or at the wrong time. | Low | High | The server-side functions will have rate-limiting logic to prevent sending more than one notification of the same type to a user within a given window (e.g., 1 hour). |
| **R-81** | Deep links from notifications are broken or lead to the wrong screen. | Medium | Medium | A centralized navigation and deep linking service must be implemented. A test plan must include manually tapping every type of notification to verify its destination. |

## 7. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Diagram] Notification Data Flow:** A sequence diagram showing the flow for both a client-scheduled notification (Trial Ending) and a server-triggered notification (Sync Error).
*   **[Mockup] Notification Settings Screen:** A high-fidelity mockup of the settings screen described in Section 5.
*   **[Mockup] Notification Banner Styles:** Mockups of the different in-app banners (e.g., Offline, Needs Re-auth).
*   **[Table] Notification Catalog:** A comprehensive table of all notifications as described in Section 4.
