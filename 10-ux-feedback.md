# PRD Section 10: User Feedback & Iteration Loops

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the complete system for collecting, analyzing, and iterating on user feedback for SyncWell. A tight, responsive feedback loop is a core strategic advantage for a solo developer, enabling the product to evolve based on real user needs rather than assumptions. This system is designed to be systematic, transparent, and efficient.

This document details the in-app mechanisms for gathering feedback, the backend process for managing it, and the public-facing methods for "closing the loop" with the user community, ensuring users feel heard and valued.

## 2. The Feedback Management System

This system describes the lifecycle of a piece of user feedback.

1.  **Collection:** Feedback is collected from multiple channels: direct support tickets, app store reviews, and a public feature-request portal (e.g., Canny.io).
2.  **Triage & Tagging:** All feedback is funneled into a central location (e.g., a dedicated Trello board or the help desk software). The developer reviews new feedback weekly and applies tags (e.g., `bug`, `feature-request`, `ux-friction`, `fitbit-integration`).
3.  **Linkage:** If the feedback is a bug report, it is linked to a new issue in the development tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues). If it's a feature request, it's linked to the corresponding item on the Canny.io portal to help track demand.
4.  **Prioritization:** During a monthly review, the developer analyzes the tagged feedback. The frequency of tags, the number of votes on Canny.io, and the strategic alignment of suggestions are used to prioritize the development backlog.
5.  **Action:** High-priority items are added to the development roadmap and scheduled for an upcoming sprint.
6.  **Close the Loop:** When a feature is shipped, the loop is closed. The Canny.io item is marked as "Complete," automatically notifying everyone who voted for it. The app's changelog also credits the community.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### In-App Mechanisms

*   **Smart In-App Rating Prompt:**
    *   **Logic:** The prompt will be triggered only if `(successful_sync_count >= 20 OR historical_sync_completed == true) AND days_since_install >= 14 AND last_prompt_date < 90_days_ago`. It must never interrupt a user mid-task.
    *   **Flow:** The prompt will be a custom in-app dialog with a 1-5 star rating.
        *   If rating is 4-5 stars: Display a message like "Thanks! We're so glad you're enjoying SyncWell. Would you mind leaving a review on the App Store?" with a "Leave Review" button.
        *   If rating is 1-3 stars: Display "We're sorry to hear that. We want to make it right. Could you tell us what we can do better?" with a "Give Feedback" button that navigates to the Help Center. This prevents "rage-rating" on the app store.
*   **Public Feature Request Portal (Canny.io):**
    *   **Integration:** A "Feature Requests" link in the Help Center will lead to an embedded `WebView` of the public Canny.io board.
    *   **Statuses:** The developer will actively maintain the status of requests on the board: `Under Consideration`, `Planned`, `In Progress`, `Complete`.
*   **"What's New" Changelog:**
    *   **Trigger:** Appears automatically on the first launch after an update.
    *   **Content:** Will use bullet points to highlight new features and bug fixes. For community-driven features, it will explicitly state: "âœ… **New Integration: Polar!** (As requested by 150+ of you on our feedback portal!)".

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Non-Intrusive:** Feedback mechanisms must not get in the way of the app's core functionality.
*   **Transparency:** The public status of feature requests on the Canny.io board is a key requirement.
*   **Low Friction:** Submitting feedback or voting for a feature should take no more than two taps from the Help Center.

## 5. KPIs / Success Metrics

*   **Feedback-to-Feature Rate:** The percentage of features in each new release that can be directly traced back to a specific user request or feedback trend. Goal: >50%.
*   **Feature Request Engagement:** Total number of unique users who vote or comment on the feedback portal per month.
*   **"Closed Loop" Notifications:** The number of users notified about a completed feature they voted for.
*   **Positive Review Rate:** The percentage of app store ratings that are 4 or 5 stars. Goal: >85%.
*   **NPS Score:** A periodic Net Promoter Score survey will be conducted to measure overall user loyalty.

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

(This section remains largely the same but is included for completeness.)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-28** | The volume of feedback becomes too high for the solo developer to manage effectively. | Medium | Medium | The described feedback management system (tagging, prioritizing) is the primary mitigation. Focus on trends, not every single comment. |
| **R-29** | Negative feedback is not handled well, leading to public complaints and damage to the app's reputation. | Medium | High | Respond to negative feedback promptly and professionally. Acknowledge the user's frustration and be transparent about how you plan to address their concerns. |
| **R-30** | Users feel that their feedback is being ignored, leading to disillusionment and churn. | Low | High | The public Canny.io board with visible statuses is the key mitigation. Actively showing that requests are being reviewed and planned, even before they are built, builds enormous trust. |

## 7. Optional Visuals / Diagram Placeholders
*   **[Diagram] The Feedback Lifecycle:** A detailed flowchart showing the entire process from "Collection" to "Close the Loop" as described in Section 2.
*   **[Mockup] Smart Rating Prompt:** A mockup of the custom in-app rating dialog, showing both the "high rating" and "low rating" paths.
*   **[Mockup] Public Feedback Portal:** A screenshot of a well-organized Canny.io board, showing requests with different statuses.
*   **[Mockup] "What's New" Screen:** A mockup of the changelog, highlighting a community-requested feature.
